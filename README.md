#About this Project
This is a project to rennovate the Margaret Sanger Papers Project Electronic Edition search engine, fixing bugs and adding features where necessary. 

#New Features in Version 2.0
New features of this edition include: 
 * Items mentioned in texts are now searchable: 
  - Mentioned people. 
  - Mentioned places. 
  - Mentioned organizations. 
  - Mentioned titles.
 * Journal titles in the headers and subjects listed at the bottoms of documents are now clickable hyperlinks. 
 * Edit mode. To enter edit mode, and thereby double-space a text for easier printing, add `&editmode=TRUE` to the URL. For example, if the URL for 303046.xml is `show.php?sangerDoc=303046.xml`, then edit it so that it reads `show.php?sangerDoc=303046.xml&editmode=TRUE`, and that should double-space the document.
