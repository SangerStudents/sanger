            <p>The annual report for 1936 also disclosed the plans and
                preparations in progress for an active campaign against syphilis
                and gonorrhea.</p>
            <p>The <org reg="Bermuda Hotel Men's Association">Bermuda Hotel Men’s Assoc.</org> has
                asked the <org reg="Bermuda Health Department">Health Dept.</org> to provide facilities for the periodic
                examination of all men and women employed in hotels to insure as
                far as possible, that such employees be free from communicable
                diseases.</p>
            <p>Added to this group should be those who seek work in private
                homes, food shops and laundries. It was requested to see that
                employees have a health card to present to their prospective
                employers to show they are in sound health and free from such
                communicable ailments.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">BERMUDA HEALTH REPORT</head>
            <p>In the enlargement of clinics there will be a department for
                advice in contraception to do its best to lessen the problem of
                too many people untrained for useful work.</p>
            <p>Here again is a forward looking influence and “<q who="BHD">While
                    the legislature was disinclined to put these diseases upon
                    the list of notifiable diseases it is likely to enact
                    restraining powers upon those people who habitually spread
                    them</q>.”</p>
            <p>This of course is unfortunate. The only way to stop the spread of
                communicable or transmissible diseases is to treat them as such
                and consider them as small pox, typhoid, measles and other
                diseases should be treated--by isolation and treatment.</p>
            <p><place>Bermuda</place> is an ideal place to live in with no “depressions” in
                sight or in the rear--at least in over 300 years and not since
                1860. Before that time they had two (?) but the question of
                taxation is interesting. There is no income tax--no inheritance
                or death tax--no estate or gift or personal property tax--no
                school, no nuisance, no poll or no sales taxes. Only a tax for
                those who own real estate and that amount is at the rate of less
                than $3.00 a thousand. Bermuda is not a democracy and that’s why
                there is peace and contentment on the island.</p>
            <p>Less than 10% of its citizens can vote. Only adult males owning
                &pound;60 or $300 worth of land have the suffrage. But there is one
                representative in the legislature for every 900 of the
                population. Here you see every child and child of the colored
                population well dressed and clean and tidy. Never have I seen so
                large a group of working colored people so well fed and clothed
                as you see all over Bermuda.</p>
            <p>Here again are no criminal class. No gangs--no underworld--no
                kidnaping--no lynchings. Never in the history of this island has
                there been a lynching. There are no restrictions of race,
                religion or color regarding acquisition of property. But only
                2,000 acres of its 12,500 acres can belong to aliens (including
                Americans). This makes the section of such aliens important.
                They have a policy of selection and investigation and such alien
                must make formal application to the <person
                    reg="Hildyard, Reginald John Thornton">Governor</person> in
                Council--his name is then published in the press and objections
                can be raised and can be heard. The Governor investigates the
                applicants reputation and standing and has power to refuse. This
                power of the Governor’s has resulted in a homogeneous character
                of alien residents and has prevented that most objectionable of
                all booms--the land boom. Here there is only now beginning the
                social service such as baby clinics but the health Dept. will
                see to it that this sort of palliative interest patterned after
                American ladies use of their leisure time will go hand in hand
                with constructive social work. The Bermudean women themselves
                see thru this and many of them have refused to join the ranks of
                American to organize welfare clinics, baby creches etc. knowing
                that it will encourage the diseased to breed and prolong the
                lives of the types who become dependent and remain depend from
                the cradle to the grave. Not a dependent but a resistant
                population is what is wanted and here it has been and still
                remains in Bermuda.</p>
