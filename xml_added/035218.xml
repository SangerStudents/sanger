            <head type="sub">Birth Control.</head>
            <p>Significant developments in the world-wide birth control movement
                in 1937 related to its legal and scientific foundations,
                extension of facilities, and a more rational understanding and
                acceptance of principles and methods. Increased medical approval
                and participation were marked.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>United States</place>. --</head>
            <p>Birth control under medical direction became legal on Nov. 30,
                1936, when the <org reg="United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Second District"
                    >U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second District</org>
                rendered a decision in the <name type="case" reg="United States vs. One Package of Japanese Contraceptives"
                    >test case</name> of Dr. <person reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer"
                    >Hannah M. Stone</person>, of the <org>Birth Control
                    Clinical Research Bureau</org>, that the Federal obscenity
                laws do not apply to the legitimate activities of physicians,
                and that they may prescribe contraceptives in the interests of
                the health and general well-being of their patients. This
                decision terminated a long fight against an outmoded <name
                    type="law" reg="Comstock Act of 1873">Federal law</name>
                classifying contraceptive information and supplies with
                obscenity. Although the decision was handed down late in 1936,
                its impact and impulse to new activity were felt in 1937. This
                decision brought the movement to the goal it had sought through
                legislation.</p>
            <p>The <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
                    Control</org> dissolved, and published a final report.</p>
            <p>The <org>American Medical Association</org> approved birth
                control as an integral part of medical practice and education
                during 1937. This was one of the most important milestones in
                the movement. A report by a special committee was adopted by the
                association’s <org reg="American Medical Association, House of Delegates">House
                    of Delegates</org>. The association is investigating
                contraception and will promote the teaching of birth control in
                medical school. The importance of its attitude and activities is
                outstanding.</p>
            <p>The <title type="journal">Journal of Conception</title>, the only technical
                publication devoted to the biological and clinical aspects of
                human fertility and its control, completed its second year under
                the auspices of the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau,
                    <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>, and its 200
                affiliated clinics. The scope of the Clinical Research Bureau
                was expanded. It has provided this service to 61,000 mothers,
                serves as a clearing house of information, and promotes new
                centres. It is the first large centre for contraceptive counsel
                and the largest clinic of its kind. It enlarged its educational
                department, exhibited scientific films to medical groups,
                expanded its plans and began a campaign to induce public health
                authorities to provide birth control facilities. It continues
                its research on contraceptive products.</p>
            <p>A temporary set-back came in one American State with the
                convictions of clinic officials and staff in the lower courts of
                certain <place>Massachusetts</place> cities. These cases are
                being appealed. Legalization stimulated efforts to incorporate
                birth control into the programs of public and voluntary health,
                welfare, child-caring and maternity organizations, medical
                colleges, hospitals, health centres, and clinics. Forty-nine new
                centres were opened in 19 States.</p>
            <p>In some religious groups objections to birth control continue on
                grounds advanced as fundamental. Some rest, however, on the
                assumption of moral implications which ignore scientific facts
                and human realities. But the trend is steadily toward wider
                acceptance.</p>
