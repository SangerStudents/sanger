		<head>THE ABC’S OF BIRTH CONTROL.</head>

		<p> Everywhere we look, we see poverty and large families going hand in
			hand. We see hoards of children whose parents cannot feed, clothe or
			educate even one half of the number born to them. We see sick,
			harassed, broken mothers whose health and nerves cannot bear the
			strain of further child bearing. We see fathers growing despondent
			and desperate because their labor cannot bring the necessary wage to
			keep their growing families.. We see that those parents who are
			least fit to reproduce the race are having the largest numbers of
			children; while people of wealth, leisure and education are having
			small families.</p>
		<p>It is generally conceded by sociologists and scientists that a nation
			cannot go on indefintely multiplying without eventually reaching the
			point when population presses upon means of subsistence. While in
			this country there is perhaps no need for immediate alarm on this
			account, there are many other reasons for demanding Birth Control.
			At present for the poor mother there is only one alternative from
			the necessity of bearing children year after year, regardless of her
			health, of the welfare of the children she already has, and of the
			income of the family. This alternative is abortion which is so
			common as to be almost universal, especially where there are rigid
			laws against imparting information for the prevention of conception.
			It has been estimated that there are about one million abortions in
			the <place>United States</place> each year. To force poor mothers to
			resort to this dangerous and health destroying method of curtailing
			their families is cruel, wicked and heartless, and it is often the
			mothers who care most about the welfare of their children who are
			willing to undergo any pain or risk to prevent the coming of infants
			fo whom they cannot properly care.</p>
		<p> There are definite reasons when and why parents should not have
			children which will be conceded by most thoughtful people. <list>
				<item>1st. Children should not be born when either parent has an
					inheritable disease, such as insanity, feeble-mindedness,
					epilepsy or syphilis.</item>
				<item>2nd. When the mother is suffering from tuberculosis,
					kidney disease, heart disease or pelvic deformity.</item>
				<item> 3rd. When either parent has gonorrhea. This disease in
					the mother is the cause of 90 per cent of blindness in
					newborn babies.</item>
				<item>4th. When children already born are not normal, even
					though both parents are in good physical ↑and↓or mental
					condition.</item>
				<item>5th. Not until the woman is 23 years old and the man
					25.</item>
				<item>6th. Not until the previous baby is at least three years
					old. This gives a year to recover from the physical strain
					and ordeal of the birth of the baby, a year to rest, be
					normal and enjoy her motherhood, and another year to prepare
					for the coming of the next. We want mothers to be fit. We
					want them to conceive in joy and gladness. We want them to
					carry their babies during the nine months in a sound and
					healthy body and with a happy, joyous hopeful mind. It is
					almost impossible to imagine the suffering caused to women,
					the mental agony they endure, when their days and nights are
					haunted by the fear of <add>undesired</add> pregnancy</item>
				<item>7th. Children should not be born to parents whose economic
					circumstances do not guarantee enough to provide the
					children with the necessities of life. A couple who can take
					care of two children and bring them up decently in health
					and comfort, give them an education and start them fairly in
					life do more for their country and for mankind than the
					couple who recklessly reproduce ten or twelve children, some
					of them to die in infancy, others to survive but to enter
					the mill or factory at an early age, and all to sink to that
					level of degradation where charity, either State or private,
					is necessary to keep them alive. The man who cannot support
					three children should not have ten. notwithstanding all
					pleas of the militarists for numbers.</item>
				<item> 8th. A woman should not bear children when exhausted from
					labor. This especially applies to women who marry after
					spending several years in industrial or commercial life.
					Conception should not take place until she is in good health
					and has overcome her fatigue.</item>
				<item>9th. Not for two years after marriage should a couple
					undertake the great responsibility of becoming parents.
					Thousands of young people enter marriage without the
					faintest idea of what marriage involves. They do not know
					its spiritual responsibilities. If children are born quickly
					and plentifully people consider that the marriage is
					justified. I claim that this is barbaric and wrong. It is
					wrong for the wife, for the man, for the children. It is
					impossible for two young people to really know each other
					until they have lived together in marriage. After the
					closeness and intimacy of that relation there often comes to
					the woman a crude awakening, the devoted lover becomes
					careless and dissatisfied. If she becomes pregnant
					immediately she becomes physically disturbed, and nervous
					and irritable. The girl has changed and the boy who knew her
					as a happy smiling sweetheart finds her disagreeable and
					disgruntled. Of course thousands of people learn to adjust
					themselves. Nevertheless I maintain that young people should
					marry early and wait at least two years to adjust their own
					lives, to play and read together and to build up a cultural
					and spiritual friendship.</item>
			</list></p>
		<p> Then will come the intense desire to call into being a little child
			to share their love and happiness. When children are conceived in
			love, and born into a atmosphere of happiness, then will parenthood
			be a glorious privilege, and the children will grow to resemble
			gods. This can only be obtained through the knowledge and practice
			of Birth Control. </p>
		<p> The <org>American Birth Control League</org> desires that the
			instruction in Birth Control should be given by the medical
			profession. Only through individual care and treatment can a woman
			be given the best and safest means of controlling her offspring. We
			do not favor the indiscriminate diffusion of unreliable and unsafe
			Birth Control advice</p>
		<p>Believing that Birth Control can only be safe, harmless and effective
