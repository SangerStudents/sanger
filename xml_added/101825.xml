        <p>It was in 1914 that I began an open attack on the laws of the <place>United
                States</place> which would withhold from woman the right to regulate the size of her
            family. For the four preceding years the battleground had been my own mind and soul.</p>
        <p>As a maternity nurse in the slums and tenements of <place reg="New York, NY">New
                York</place> I had been brought face to face with conditions that made the so-called
            sacredness of motherhood a term of unspeakable irony. Pregnant women--drunken
            husbands--hungry children, children born to a heritage of disease, filth, crime--this
            was the order of the day. As one pregnancy followed another, a family sank deeper into
            the mire. And always denied contraceptive knowledge by their doctors, these women were
            driven to other means. On Saturday evenings before the office of a cheap abortionist
            they lined up, each waiting her turn. “<q>You would tell us nothing</q>,” they seemed to
            my guilty conscience to say (I knew nothing to tell them), “<q>and here we are.</q>” All
            too often wrecked health and death followed.</p>
        <p>Weighed down and haunted by the hopeless misery of these lives, ever brooding over the
            social and economic problems involved, it became clear to me at length that the root of
            the trouble lay in uncontrolled fertility. Once convinced of this, action became
            imperative. I had no choice--I <emph rend="Underline">had</emph> to do something.</p>
        <p> Under this compulsion I set about acquiring the information these women needed, a search
            which was eventually to take me to <place>France</place>, 
            <place>England</place>, and <place>Holland</place>. In the country of my birth I had to
            give up the search. State and federal laws made the printing or circulation of this
            knowledge a crime. No doctors whom I approached would give me help, and no group of any
            kind would sponsor the cause. <del>I was utterly alone.</del> They assured me that any
            efforts in so dangerous a field would land me in jail, and advised me to <del>let
                </del><add>drop</add> it<del> alone</del>. I was utterly alone.</p>
        <p>At that time there was not even a language in which to discuss these questions. The
            subject was considered indecent and vulgar. To openly advocate the prevention of
            conception--a phrase which the <title>New York Times</title> would not allow in its
            columns--meant ostracism.</p>
        <p>Such was the situation when I began my battle in 1914 in the pages of the <title>Woman
                Rebel</title> and created the term, <soCalled>‘birth control.’</soCalled> Seventeen
            years have passed. Three weeks ago the movement for advocacy of which I was arrested by
            the <org>United States government</org> in 1914 and ridiculed and insulted by
            individuals was endorsed by the <org>Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in
                America</org>. There is no force in the world, it has been said, like that of an
            idea whose hour has come.</p>
        <p>It was my prosecution by the <org>United States government</org> for articles that
            appeared in the <title>Woman Rebel</title> (articles advocating birth control, but not
            giving methods) that started people talking about birth control. A letter from <person
                reg="Wells, H.G.">H.G. Wells</person> and other distinguished Englishmen
                <add>&amp; women</add> to President <person reg="Wilson, Woodrow"
                >Wilson</person> in my behalf brought prestige, and the publicity became so great,
            with letters to the judge and the district attorney pouring in from all parts of the
            country, that the case was finally dropped. This was in 1916. In the heated period that
            followed many champions of the cause arose. Organizations were formed, there were
            meetings, speeches, published articles, pamphlets. Many were arrested, many acquitted;
            not a few served jail sentences.</p>
        <p>My own jail term came in 1917. I had opened a <soCalled>‘clinic’</soCalled> in a poor
            section of <place reg="Brooklyn, NY">Brooklyn</place> to demonstrate the direction which
            the [page 3 missing] <org>the American Birth Control League</org>, which has branches in
            many states.</p>
        <p>In <place>Europe</place> and <place>the Orient</place> the movement has had fewer
            obstacles to overcome. Until the post-war period no country had laws prohibiting the
            giving of contraceptive information. <place>Holland</place>, with its many clinics
            directed by the Dutch <org>Neo-Malthusian League</org>, has carried on the most
            consistent education of the poor in birth control, with results already perceptible in
            maternal health and in the physique of Dutch conscripts. There are now clinics in
                <place>Germany</place>, <place>Austria</place>, <place>Russia</place>,
                <place>India</place>, and <place>Japan</place>.</p>
        <p>In <place>England</place> it was that the modern birth control movement had its earliest
            beginning, with <person reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert">Malthus</person>’ “<title>Theory of
                Population</title>,” published in 1798. And in <place>England</place> it was that I
            found sympathy and guidance in the early days when I seemed to stand alone. At the time
            of my first visit there, in 1914, the idea was being kept alive <add>by</add> the
                <org>Malthusian League</org>, but it hardly touched the masses. When I was invited
            in 1920 to come over for a series of lectures the working classes were being aroused,
            and I addressed twenty women’s guilds. The following year two clinics opened, and the
            movement has grown by leaps and bounds on the foundation laid by such pioneers as
                <person reg="Besant, Annie">Annie Besant</person> and <person
                reg="Bradlaugh, Charles">Charles Bradlaugh</person>, the Drysdale family, and Dr.
                <person reg="Vickery, Alice">Alice Vickery</person>. Today there are about
            twenty-five clinics, and the <org>Ministry of Health</org> now allows the giving of
            contraceptive advice at its Maternity and Child Welfare Centers, of which there are
            nearly 2500 scattered over the country.</p>
        <p>The most imperative need for birth control today exists in the Oriental countries. In
            1922 I was invited by a liberal group in <place reg="Toyko, Japan">Tokyo</place> to come
            to Japan to present the subject there. The enthusiasm and publicity aroused in both
            Japan and <place>China</place> was tremendous. Never has my calendar been so crowded
            with lectures, conferences, interviews and social functions. Organizations were formed,
            and clinics have since been started, and in 1930 the <org>Japanese government</org> sent
            an official representative to the international conference at <del>
                <place reg="Geneva, Switzerland">Geneva</place>
            </del>
            <place reg="Zurich, Switzerland">Zurich</place>.</p>
        <p>In <place>Italy</place>, <place>France</place>, and <place>Ireland</place>, Catholic
            strongholds all, new laws have been passed against birth control. That same France where
            contraceptive knowledge has been handed down from mother to daughter for generations,
            where the first international conference on birth control was held in 1900, has now made
            it a crime even to discuss the subject in the press.</p>
        <p> Seven international conferences have been held. A great event for <add>the movement
                in</add> America was the holding of the sixth conference in <place
                reg="New York, NY">New York</place> in 1925, with delegates from twelve countries. A
            contraceptive session for doctors only was attended by a thousand doctors. An American
            biologist and college president, Dr. <person reg="Little, C.C.">C.C. Little</person>
            became president of the <org>International <add>Federation of Birth Control</add>
                League</org>, reorganized at that time.</p>
        <p>A significant event was the World Population Conference in Geneva in 1927. While birth
            control had no direct place on its program, the connection was obvious. A permanent body
            for the study of population was formed, <del>with Dr. <person reg="East, E.M.">E.M.
                    East</person> of <org>Johns Hopkins University</org> in Baltimore at its
                head</del>. And the doctors who attended that conference brought about the formation
            of the <org>International Medical Group for the Investigation of Birth Control</org>.
            This important body correlates ↑and disseminates↓ the results of scientific research on
            contraception in all countries. It has its headquarters in <place reg="London, England"
                >London</place>
            <add>where</add> we have also an international information center <del>in
            London</del>.</p>
        <p>The final step for breaking down the barriers in America remains to be taken. The battle
            is not won while the present laws stand on our state and federal statute books. In 1929
            I organized the <org>Federal Committee on Legislation for Birth Control</org>, believing
            that the time had come to prepare for a vigorous campaign on Congress. Our
                <soCalled>“doctors bill”</soCalled> was introduced in the last session of the Senate
            by Sen. <person reg="Gillett, John">Gillett</person>, and a most favorable impression
            was made at the committee hearing. The bill will be re-introduced, we hope, at the next
            session. This amendment would open up the mails to doctors for the transportation of
            contraceptive literature and materials.</p>
        <p>There is no question but that there is an overwhelming sentiment in the country for birth
            control, but until that sentiment becomes more articulate Congress will not act. Once a
            matter like this is entrenched in law, only an avalanche of public opinion can free it.
            Negligence, reticence, or mere lack of social consciousness prevents people from
            speaking out. For many the old taboo of silence and secrecy still prevails and it seems
            indelicate to lift up one’s voice-–yes, even though on that depends the relief of untold
            misery and the greatest step forward for freedom and growth that woman has ever taken.
            If every mother who in her own life has reaped the benefit of this knowledge would do
            her bit to unseal it for the masses, how <del>speeded</del>
            <add>it would speed</add> the day <del>would be</del>! If every man and woman who
            believes in birth control would only become articulate to the extent of writing to a
            senator or representative, how overwhelming and immediate the victory would be!</p>
        <p>Then indeed my vision of a future when motherhood will be really free would seem on its
            way to fulfillment. For the time will come when the bearing of children, no longer an
            enforced burden, no longer haphazard and accidental, need only be undertaken as a
            cherished privilege; and every child will be a wanted child, born to its rightful
            heritage of love and care and comfort. Then truly will motherhood be the flower of
            womanhood. </p>
