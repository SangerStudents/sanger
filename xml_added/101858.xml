        <head>BIRTH CONTROL AND RELIGION</head>
        <p>Proponents and opponents of birth control quote scripture to support their point of view,
            and the number of quotations on each side will probably total to an equal number. A
            better way of determining where religious organizations stand on this issue is to
            consider the actual organized religious groups which have expressed an opinion on the
            subject. Outstanding among those who have placed themselves on record as supporting the
            principles of birth control are the <org reg="Episcopal House of Bishops">House of
                Bishops</org> and the <org reg="Episcopal House of Deputies">House of Deputies</org>
            of the <org>Episcopal Church</org>, the <org
                reg="Federal Council of the Church of Christ in America, Committee on Marriage and the Family"
                >Committee on Marriage and the Home of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ
                in America</org>, the <org>Unitarian Associations</org>, the <org>Universalist
                General Convention</org>, <org reg="Methodist Church Regional Conferences">Regional
                Conferences of the Methodist Church</org>, a Special Committee of the Women’s
            Problems Group of <org
                reg="Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends">Philadelphia
                Yearly Meeting of Friends</org>, the <org>Rabbinical Assembly of America</org>, the
                <org>General Council of Congregational and Christian Churches</org>, and the
                <org>Central Conference of American Rabbis</org>. Add to these and many others, the
            support of special and local organizations within the general denominational divisions
            and we have a pretty complete united front of the Protestant and Jewish faiths,
            endorsing birth control as an aid to mortality and happy marriage. Lay groups affiliated
            with the church, such as <org reg="Young Women's Christian Association">Y.W.C.A.</org>,
                <org reg="Young Men's Christian Association">Y.M.C.A</org>., <org>National Council
                of Jewish Women</org>, and other women’s church organizations, bring up
            reinforcements.</p>
        <p>What is the reasoning behind this support? Birth control, it is felt, will make for
            earlier marriages and happier marriages. Many young people will marry and start a home
            if they can feel that they can postpone the arrival of children and plan their families,
            instead of leaving the matter to blind and ruthless chance. Many a marriage will be
            preserved if birth control can be used to space the arrival of babies to conserve the
            mother’s health so that she can make an adequate home life for herself, her husband, and
            her children.</p>
        <p>Reverend <person reg="Clinchy, Russell J.">Russell J. Clinchy</person>, Minister of the
                <org>Mount Pleasant Congregational Church</org> in <place reg="Washington, DC"
                >Washington</place>, summed the matter up recently in an address as follows: “<q
                who="CLIRU">There is now laid before mankind a new power which may be used in the
                creation of healthier, happier, more richly endowed generations of children; of
                homes in which children may be given an adequate birthright and the fullest portion
                of love and care; of marriage in which the spectre of unwanted pregnancies need not
                occur; of a social order which may be created without war and economic disaster
                through overpopulation. For those who believe that the knowledge of the universe is
                of <name type="deity">God</name>, birth control, this new power, will open the gates
                of life and usefulness, and will bring the realization of the true joy and meaning
                of human love</q>.”</p>
