        <head>EXCERPTS FROM MRS. MARGARET SANGER'S ADDRESS</head>
        <p>“I urge the immediate amendment of the present federal laws which tie the hands of the
            physician and obstruct an adequate and scientific national birth control program. More
            than 1,000 organizations, with millions of members, have endorsed our efforts to change
            these obsolete federal laws, and 200,000 individuals have pledged their support over
            their personal signatures.”</p>
        <p>“It is easy to boast about birth control clinics, and point with pride to their growth
            since I opened the first clinic in <place reg="United States">America</place> in the
            slums of <place reg="Brooklyn, NY">Brooklyn</place> in 1916. This clinic, as you know,
            was closed as a ‘public nuisance,’ and I and my co-workers were sent to jail. Two
            hundred and fifty clinics in forty-three states are functioning today. But for every
            woman who goes to a clinic or to a private doctor and gets birth control information,
            there are hundreds of thousands who apply to hospitals and doctors and are denied
            instruction which they need to preserve health and life itself. Quack nostrums,
            ineffectual and often harmful contraceptive supplies may be bought at any drug store,
            and when these fail, women can in desperation submit to abortions. But scientific and
            reliable birth control instruction is the privilege of the few. The great mass of
            American mothers ask for it in vain.”</p>
        <p>“Private charity can never effectively take care of this situation. As a part of
            preventive medicine and public health, it is work which the <org
                reg="United States Government">Government</org> can no longer ignore. Let us clear
            away the legal obstructions which retard birth control work--now, at once, without
            further dallying. Then we can go forward to the inspiring and constructive program of
            giving to every mother the information which she needs, and which is her constitutional
            right.”</p>
        <p>“Statistics from <place>Pennsylvania</place> show how great is the need in your State for
            scientific and reliable birth control. Maternal deaths from all causes decreased from
            1136 in 1930 to 931 in 1934. Deaths from abortion, however, increased, and of those the
            number caused by septic poisoning also increased. Of every 100 women who die during
            maternity, 95 die from abortion, and of these 25, 20 die from septic poisoning which
            generally follows abortions performed without the proper medical safeguards. Give women
            birth control information and they will not have to submit to abortions.”</p>
        <p>“Turning to the relief question, <org reg="United States Works Progress Administration"
                >W.P.A.</org> figures show that 147,375 families in Pennsylvania were on relief in
            May, 1936. This figure is estimated to represent nearly 700,000 people--men, women, and
            children in your State. The cost of relief in Pennsylvania for this month was
            $5,305,000, and the total cost for the United States for the month of May was
            $41,800,000.”</p>
