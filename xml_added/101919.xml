        <div type="section">
            <p>“<q who="UNK">Can it be possible that there is any way to keep
                    from having children? It would seem too good to be true. I
                    have six children, my youngest two months old and I am just
                    scared to death for fear I shall have another child, for I
                    never can live to go through with it again</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I came near dying this time. For three months
                    before my last baby was born I could not get any shoes on my
                    feet and I could hardly get my eyes open to see</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">The doctor wanted to take the baby away when I was
                    eight months, but I said ‘no.’ I did not care if I lived or
                    died and I did not have the least idea of living, but the
                    Lord spared me, probably so I could go through with it
                    again. But I live on the banks of <place>Lake Erie</place>
                    and just as sure as I get in the family way again, I will
                    end my troubles and be at rest</q>.”</p>
            <p>* * * *</p>
            <p>If you were to receive a letter like this, wouldn’t you want to
                help? Every day such letters come to me in <place
                    reg="Washington, D.C., United States">Washington</place>.
                Here is another one:</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I am writing you an earnest letter. I have a child
                    every year and I am so weak and run down and nervous I can
                    hardly care for my five children, who are sickly all the
                    time, and for the new baby</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">At night, when I go to bed, I always pray that I’ll
                    never wake up again for I hate the dawn of a new day. Life
                    is miserable for me and when you live through days of
                    torture like that you may as well be dead. My oldest is
                    seven and I have had one miscarriage</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I get that way every year and when I know I am that
                    way I take everything so I don’t have to bring another
                    unwanted, sickly babe that connot be taken care of properly
                    nor fed properly, into the home. But it seems nothing helps,
                    and it only hurts my health. So I make a last and final plea
                    to see if you can give me any information telling me how to
                    keep from getting any more children. I would gladly do
                    without a loaf of bread so I could get this help</q>.”</p>
            <p>Here is yet another:</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I have asked my doctor oh! so many times to tell me
                    something to do to prevent conception, but he won’t tell. It
                    is easy enough for him to say, “<q who="UNK">Now you take
                        your life in your hands if you have any more
                        children</q>.’ It’s easy for him to say that, but he
                    won’t tell me how not to have any more, and I am determined
                    to find out</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I am twenty-three, and I already have three
                    children. I was married when I was nineteen, a woman in
                    years but a child otherwise. I was raised by one of these
                    mothers who believe girls should be kept in and know nothing
                    until they are married. I love my mother but she believes,
                        ‘<q who="UNK">let nature take its course; what God sends
                        take and keep quiet</q>.’ Is it any wonder I am asking,
                    yes, even praying, for help? I am so weak I can hardly stand
                    up and I have my home to take care of and my babies besides,
                    as we cannot afford help. It’s just a case of get up and do
                    it. My husband is only a boy of twenty-five, and works day
                    and night. He is losing his health with worry. He is a
                    helper on the railroad at forty-seven cents an hour. That
                    was enough when we were first married but babies and
                    hospital and doctor bills take too much and we cannot go on
                    like this, having a baby every year</q>.”</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <p>Literally, thousands of letters like these have come to me since
                I opened America’s first <org
                    reg="Brownsville Birth Control Clinic">Birth Control
                    Clinic</org> in 1916. Remember they are real letters from
                real women, and behind each one is a story of suffering and
                unhappiness that might have been--should be--avoided.</p>
            <p>Take the three letters quoted! The woman who wrote the first, who
                could hardly get her eyes open to see for three months before
                her sixth child was born, is obviously physically unfit for
                further child-bearing. If she is to be saved to bring up the
                children she now has, she must have safe and reliable birth
                control advice.</p>
            <p>The second woman tells of her attempts to bring on a miscarriage,
                and of her sickly brood of six. In many cases such as this, the
                woman, in desperation, goes to an abortionist, and commits that
                crime which all women in their souls rebel against. How much
                better it is to tell mothers how to prevent, in order that they
                will not have to destroy.</p>
            <p>The posters used, announcing the opening of the first birth
                control clinic, made this clear. It said: “Mothers! Can you
                afford to have a large family? Do you want any more children? If
                not, why do you have them? Do not kill, do not take life, but
                prevent!” This was repeated in Yiddish and in Italian, for this
                first clinic was opened in one of <place
                    reg="New York City, New York">New York</place>’s crowded
                districts, where many of the women cannot understand
                English.</p>
            <p>Now let us analyze the deplorable condition depicted in the third
                letter. . . a young couple with three children. Figure for
                yourself what will happen to this worried young couple in five,
                ten or fifteen year, unless help, in the shape of birth control
                advice, is given to this young woman.</p>
            <p>And yet, tragic as her case is, it would be considered “easy
                street” to thousands, nay millions of women. At least her
                husband is at work. True his wages are small, and they will not
                grow (the chances are) as his family grows. But every family on
                relief, every family where the man is unemployed is faced with a
                worse problem.</p>
            <p>And by the latest official count there are now four million
                eighty-five thousand families in <place reg="United States">America</place>
                dependent for their very existence on public relief. Literally
                millions of mothers are living in fear of adding to their
                already heavy burdens the tragedy of another, and unwanted
                child.</p>
            <p>These women ask little in life, their needs are few. They want
                above all to help themselves.</p>
            <p>What chance of happiness is there for them if their lives are
                full of fear and dread? What basis is there for a happy home if,
                with their husbands out of work, or barely earning enough for
                two, babies keep coming, year after year, making just so many
                more hungry mouths to feed? These women love their babies-- love
                them too much to want to see them suffer from want, when they
                know there is so little with which to provide for the future in
                this difficult world. They want to take care of a few children
                decently and not live in squalor with a new baby each year,
                draining the mother’s health and the father’s pocket-book, or
                more often, dependent on public relief. I speak as a mother
                myself, and also as a trained nurse and social worker.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <p>It was many years ago that I first started to work among the
                mothers on the East side of <place reg="New York City, NY">New
                    York City</place>, in the crowded slum districts. It was
                there that the tragic need for scientific family limitation was
                brought brutally before me.</p>
            <p>The conditions that exist there among the families of the very
                poor are known to all who have worked in the slums of large
                cities. To the fortunate citizens of small towns and villages,
                they are indescribable. Large families crowded together in one
                or two tiny rooms, dark and airless. Boarders often taken in
                when there is really hardly room enough for the family, but the
                extra money is desperately needed. Parents, children, boarders,
                all huddled together in the same room, and often in the same
                bed. Women pregnant, year in, year out.</p>
            <p>Here, in that atmosphere, the facts of life are common knowledge.
                Birth and abortion and death are frequent topics of
                conversation. Life for these women is an unending succession of
                child-bearing. They try anything to keep from having so many
                babies; all sorts of drugs, teas and hot baths to bring
                themselves “around” when they are in the “family-way.” When
                these fail, they try a crude operation, sometimes
                self-inflicted, sometimes performed by a professional
                abortionist. If they survive, then they are considered lucky;
                but too often they die.</p>
            <p>One terrifically hot mid-summer day I was called to take care of
                    <person reg="Sachs, Sadie">Mrs. Doe</person> (I shall call
                her by that name although it is not her real one) a young
                East-side mother of twenty-eight. She was married to a nice
                young fellow of thirty-two and they had three little children.
                They loved each other and the babies dearly and were struggling
                along on the meager wages that <person reg="Sachs, Jake">Mr.
                    Doe</person> was earning.</p>
            <p>But it was the same old story. When I arrived, Mrs. Doe was
                prostrate on the floor. She, knowing of the struggle to eke out
                a bare living for the little ones they already had, was unable
                to face the prospect of another baby. She had used some
                instrument upon herself, lent to her by a friend.</p>
            <p>For weeks we nursed that little woman as she hovered between life
                and death. Finally we pulled her through. But, though the
                neighbors were kind and brought her little gifts and good things
                to eat and she was getting better each day, still nothing seemed
                to cheer her. She was depressed and disconsolate.</p>
            <p>Finally one day, after the doctor had pronounced her well and was
                preparing to leave, he told her to be careful and not let
                herself become pregnant again.</p>
            <p>“<q who="SACSA">I suppose another baby will be my end. Doctor,
                    tell me what can I do to keep from it?</q>” she said.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">Oh, ho</q>,” laughed the doctor in good humor, “<q
                    who="UNK">You can’t have your cake and eat it, too!” Tell
                    Jake to sleep on the roof.</q>” With that he went out the
                door and left us.</p>
            <p>I shall never forget the look on that woman’s face. Tremendous
                emotions were surging within her.</p>
            <p>Conquering her feelings, she turned to me beseechingly, “<q
                    who="SACSA">Tell me the secret</q>,” she begged. “<q
                    who="SACSA">Tell me--and I’ll never breathe it to
                soul!</q>”</p>
            <p>But what could I tell her? I really did not know myself! Tears
                filled my eyes and she knew that I was sympathetic. But I could
                do nothing to help her.</p>
            <p>Some weeks later, Mr. Doe called me on the ‘phone. Instantly I
                knew what had happened. On my way I prayed for an accident to
                overtake me. I could not bear to face Mrs. Doe’s reproachful
                eyes, to see her suffering so needlessly.</p>
            <p>She died ten minutes after I arrived. She never regained
                consciousness and did not know I was there. Her young husband
                paced the floor in despair, wringing his hands and weeping
                bitterly. Her three little children, left motherless, were
                sobbing in a corner.</p>
            <p>It was then that my whole world--my whole outlook on life
                changed.</p>
            <p>I walked home in a daze, weary and heart-sick. I walked and
                walked and all the while the resolve within me kept growing
                stronger and stronger: <emph rend="italics">I will do something
                    to help these women!</emph></p>
            <p>The dawn was rising as I reached my room and I stood at my window
                and looked out over the sleeping city. I seemed to be seeing
                right into those millions of lives and into the very heart of
                those homes, stretching across the great city. I could feel
                myself the awful fear pressing on these families and causing
                them such untold misery and degradation. Little children forced
                into factories to help feed the newer arrivals; women, always
                pregnant, afraid, cowed, overworked; men, unable to take care of
                their ever-increasing families, becoming sullen, drunken,
                sinking lower and lower. Social welfare was only a
                palliative--the root of the evil needed to be reached.</p>
            <p>I threw my nursing bag across the room, pulled off my nurses
                uniform, and made up my mind never again to nurse only women’s
                bodies while the real cause of their trouble was left untouched.
                Women have a right to know about their own bodies; they should
                know about birth control. I would tell the world what was
                happening. <emph>I would be heard!</emph></p>

            <p>It may be well to stop here, and make clear just what birth
                control is . . . and what it is not.</p>
            <p>A couple--shy, young, evidently recently married--stand
                hesitating at the door of the clinic in New York. It is a nice,
                old-fashioned, and, I think, inviting door leading into what was
                once a large family house. Nothing forbidding, nothing
                institutional. The door opens and they are invited in by a
                pleasant young woman. They find themselves in a cheerful,
                home-like room, talking things over with a woman doctor.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Bride (for indeed she is one, in New York on her wedding
                trip) is speaking. “<q who="UNK">John and I have such grand
                    plans. We have a little apartment all ready for us back
                    home, and we want to have children as soon as we are able to
                    take care of them. But what we want to know. . . people tell
                    you all sorts of thins. . . and talk and talk one doesn’t
                    know right from wrong</q> . . .” She stammered and grew
                confused.</p>
            <p>The kindly doctor was used to young brides. She explained that
                birth control, rightly used, was safe and reliable. She said
                that, in her opinion, it was better for a young couple to have a
                year or so to get used to each other before the wife became
                pregnant. “<q who="UNK">First learn to know each other as man
                    and woman, as comrades, before you become parents</q>,” she
                said.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">And can we surely have children when we want
                    them?</q>” asked earnest John.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">Well, no one can answer that</q>,” the doctor
                replied. “<q who="UNK">But I can tell you that birth control
                    will do you no harm. Wise parents use birth control except
                    when they want to have a baby. After the baby’s birth, they
                    again use birth control, so that the next baby won’t come
                    too soon</q>.”</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">You mean that people can plan just how many
                    children to have and when to have them?</q>”</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">Exactly. Children should not come too close
                    together. They should not come when the mother is not
                    entirely well and strong. They should not come when the
                    father cannot support them</q>.”</p>
            <p>The doctor’s careful explanation may be summed up as follows:
                There are many things to be though of in planning the size of a
                family, but three are most important. <emph rend="italics">First
                    the mother’s health</emph>: No woman should attempt to bring
                a baby into the world if she has tuberculosis, heart or kidney
                disease. These are illnesses which can usually be cured, if
                taken in time, and if the mother’s strength is not drained by
                pregnancy. <emph rend="italics">Second, the father’s
                    earnings</emph>: One would think that everyone would agree
                that a family should have no more children than they can
                support. But many, many couples are trying to live on pitifully
                small incomes, and millions of families among the unemployed are
                unable to get birth control information. <emph rend="italics"
                    >The third reason is child spacing</emph>. This means that
                the children should not come too close together, that a woman
                should have plenty of time to get her strength back after
                pregnancy before another child is on the way.</p>
            <p>Dr. <person reg="Holden, Dr. Frederick C.">Frederick C.
                    Holden</person>, a very wise and good doctor, has put this
                well in one sentence. “<q who="HOLFR">A wise father and mother
                    will have as many children as can be safely carried, safely
                    born and adequately reared</q>.”</p>
            <p>This sums up, in its simplest terms, what birth control IS. What
                it is not, the nurses and doctors at birth control clinics must
                explain daily with patience and sympathy.</p>
            <p>Shortly after young John and Mrs. John had left the clinic, armed
                with information which will give them a good chance for
                happiness, a frightened, bedraggled woman rang the door bell. A
                child clung to her skirt, she carried a sickly baby in her arms.
                Before the nurse had time even to ask her name, she cried out:
                    “<q who="UNK">Thees one, and thees one</q>,” pointing to the
                baby, “<q who="UNK">and mucha plenty more bambino at home. Now
                    comes again bambino, I no can do . . . you feex . . .</q>”
                and she burst into a flood of Italian, sobbing and rocking to
                and fro.</p>
            <p>A woman doctor who spoke Italian soothed and quieted her and got
                her story. Husband out of work; three children at home--one a
                cripple. The baby always ailing, six months old, and now she was
                again pregnant. She wanted an abortion. But birth control is not
                abortion, and there was no help for her. She had come too late.
                Earnestly the doctor urged her to be brave, to have this baby,
                and then come again after the baby’s birth, and find out about
                birth control.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <p>I coined this term <emph rend="italics">birth control</emph> in
                1914. I started on my life work to bring this knowledge to every
                married woman who needs it and wants it. For twenty-one years I
                have fought for the right of women to have only wanted children,
                for the right of women to have birth control information. This
                    <org reg="Birth Control Comes of Age Anniversary Dinner"
                    >twenty-first Anniversary dinner</org> showed how near--and
                how far--we are from the goal.</p>
            <p>Birth control is an accepted term. Its meaning is clear. It is
                endorsed by doctors and by ministers, by social workers, nurses,
                thoughtful and intelligent men and women the world over. The
                list of national groups, who have endorsed this work, runs to
                over a thousand. The most recent endorsements of birth control
                and of our efforts to change the Federal law are from the
                    <org>General Federation of Women’s Clubs</org>, and the
                    <org>American Association of University Women</org>. The
                General Federation represents 2,000,000 women and the University
                group 450,000.</p>
            <p>The East side clinic, about which I have told you, was closed as
                a “public nuisance” and both my sister and I served prison
                sentences as a result. But as a result, too, at my trial, the
                decision was issued that in New York state birth control
                instruction may be given to a married person by a physician for
                the “cure or prevention of disease.”</p>
            <p>On the strength of this decision, I was able to open a legal
                clinic in 1923. It has been caring for the women of New York
                ever since, for the young brides and the mothers broken down by
                many childbirths, for women of all nationalities and classes and
                races. It has made possible over ten thousand women, healthier
                and happier lives. This clinic has been a model and an
                inspiration for other clinics elsewhere. Today there are
                approximately 200 clinics in the <place>United States</place>,
                taking care of poor women who needed birth control advice.</p>
            <p>It would seem that the goal is near. But, though I am thankful
                that so much has been done, though my heart goes out in
                gratitude to the loyal friends who have helped me, the goal is,
                as I have said, still far off.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <p>What needs still to be done must be done by the nation as a
                whole, by all women and by their husbands, by those who feel as
                I did on that far-off dawn when I dedicated myself to this
                task.</p>
            <p>The women of America, because of their love for children, want
                safe and reliable birth control information. They have a right
                to this knowledge. They have a right to bring into the world
                children joyfully conceived and happily awaited, children whom
                they can rear with love and some measure of economic
                security.</p>
            <p>Today, despite the support of thoughtful and influential people,
                despite scientific findings and the efforts of doctors,
                ministers and social workers, thousands upon thousands of women
                ask for birth control advice in vain.</p>
            <p>Laws passed over sixty years ago class this knowledge with
                obscenity and make it illegal to send birth control information
                or supplies through the mail. Bills now before <org
                    reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> will, if passed,
                make if possible for doctors, hospitals and clinics to give
                birth control advice when needed. Then thousands of hospitals
                and the <org reg="United States Public Health Service">Public
                    Health Service of the United States</org> government could
                give this information to mothers too poor to go to a private
                physician.</p>
            <p>Here is true democracy. Here is a chance to give to every mother
                in America the right to decide when she should undertake that
                most noble career, motherhood.</p>
