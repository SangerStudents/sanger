        <div type="section">
            <p>“<q who="UNK">Can it be possible that there is any way to keep from having children?
                    It would seem too good to be true. I have six children, my youngest two months
                    old and I am just scared to death for fear I shall have another child, for I
                    never can live to go through with it again</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I came near dying this time. For three months before my last baby was
                    born I could not get any shoes on my feet and I could hardly get my eyes open to
                    see</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">The doctor wanted to take the baby away when I was eight months, but I
                    said ‘no.’ I did not care if I lived or died and I did not have the least idea
                    of living, but the Lord spared me, probably so I could go through with it again.
                    But I live on the banks of <place>Lake Erie</place> and just as sure as I get in
                    the family way again, I will end my troubles and be at rest</q>.”</p>
            <p>* * * *</p>
            <p>If you were to receive a letter like this, wouldn’t you want to help? Every day such
                letters come to me in Washington. Here is another one:</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I am writing you an earnest letter. I have a child every year and I am
                    so weak and run down and nervous I can hardly care for my five children, who are
                    sickly all the time, and for the new baby</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">At night, when I go to bed, I always pray that I’ll never wake up again
                    for I hate the dawn of a new day. Life is miserable for me and when you live
                    through days of torture like that you may as well be dead. My oldest is seven
                    and I have had one miscarriage</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I get that way every year and when I know I am that way I take
                    everything so I don’t have to bring another unwanted, sickly babe that connot be
                    taken care of properly nor fed properly, into the home. But it seems nothing
                    helps, and it only hurts my health. So I make a last and final plea to see if
                    you can give me any information telling me how to keep from getting any more
                    children. I would gladly do without a loaf of bread so I could get this
                help</q>.”</p>
            <p>Here is yet another:</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I have asked my doctor oh! so many times to tell me something to do to
                    prevent conception, but he won’t tell. It is easy enough for him to say, “<q
                        who="UNK">Now you take your life in your hands if you have any more
                        children</q>.’ It’s easy for him to say that, but he won’t tell me how not
                    to have any more, and I am determined to find out</q>.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">I am twenty-three, and I already have three children. I was married
                    when I was nineteen, a woman in years but a child otherwise. I was raised by one
                    of these mothers who believe girls should be kept in and know nothing until they
                    are married. I love my mother but she believes, ‘<q who="UNK">let nature take
                        its course; what God sends take and keep quiet</q>.’ Is it any wonder I am
                    asking, yes, even praying, for help? I am so weak I can hardly stand up and I
                    have my home to take care of and my babies besides, as we cannot afford help.
                    It’s just a case of get up and do it. My husband is only a boy of twenty-five,
                    and works day and night. He is losing his health with worry. He is a helper on
                    the railroad at forty-seven cents an hour. That was enough when we were first
                    married but babies and hospital and doctor bills take too much and we cannot go
                    on like this, having a baby every year</q>.”</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <p>Literally, thousands of letters like these have come to me since I opened <place
                    reg="United States">America</place>’s first <org reg="Brownsville Clinic">Birth
                    Control Clinic</org> in 1916. Remember they are real letters from real women,
                and behind each one is a story of suffering and unhappiness that might have
                been--should be--avoided.</p>
            <p>Take the three letters quoted! The woman who wrote the first, who could hardly get
                her eyes open to see for three months before her sixth child was born, is obviously
                physically unfit for further child-bearing. If she is to be saved to bring up the
                children she now has, she must have safe and reliable birth control advice.</p>
            <p>The second woman tells of her attempts to bring on a miscarriage, and of her sickly
                brood of six. In many cases such as this, the woman, in desperation, goes to an
                abortionist, and commits that crime which all women in their souls rebel against.
                How much better it is to tell mothers how to prevent, in order that they will not
                have to destroy.</p>
            <p>The posters used, announcing the opening of the first birth control clinic, made this
                clear. It said: “Mothers! Can you afford to have a large family? Do you want any
                more children? If not, why do you have them? Do not kill, do not take life, but
                prevent!” This was repeated in Yiddish and in Italian, for this first clinic was
                opened in one of <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>’s crowded districts,
                where many of the women cannot understand English.</p>
            <p>Now let us analyze the deplorable condition depicted in the third letter. . . a young
                couple with three children. Figure for yourself what will happen to this worried
                young couple in five, ten or fifteen year, unless help, in the shape of birth
                control advice, is given to this young woman.</p>
            <p>And yet, tragic as her case is, it would be considered “easy street” to thousands,
                nay millions of women. At least her husband is at work. True his wages are small,
                and they will not grow (the chances are) as his family grows. But every family on
                relief, every family where the man is unemployed is faced with a worse problem.</p>
            <p>And by the latest official count there are now four million eighty-five thousand
                families in America dependent for their very existence on public relief. Literally
                millions of mothers are living in fear of adding to their already heavy burdens the
                tragedy of another, and unwanted child.</p>
            <p>These women ask little in life, their needs are few. They want above all to help
                themselves.</p>
            <p>What chance of happiness is there for them if their lives are full of fear and dread?
                What basis is there for a happy home if, with their husbands out of work, or barely
                earning enough for two, babies keep coming, year after year, making just so many
                more hungry mouths to feed? These women love their babies-- love them too much to
                want to see them suffer from want, when they know there is so little with which to
                provide for the future in this difficult world. They want to take care of a few
                children decently and not live in squalor with a new baby each year, draining the
                mother’s health and the father’s pocket-book, or more often, dependent on public
                relief. I speak as a mother myself, and also as a trained nurse and social
                worker.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <p>It was many years ago that I first started to work among the mothers on the East side
                of New York City, in the crowded slum districts. It was there that the tragic need
                for scientific family limitation was brought brutally before me.</p>
            <p>The conditions that exist there among the families of the very poor are known to all
                who have worked in the slums of large cities. To the fortunate citizens of small
                towns and villages, they are indescribable. Large families crowded together in one
                or two tiny rooms, dark and airless. Boarders often taken in when there is really
                hardly room enough for the family, but the extra money is desperately needed.
                Parents, children, boarders, all huddled together in the same room, and often in the
                same bed. Women pregnant, year in, year out.</p>
            <p>Here, in that atmosphere, the facts of life are common knowledge. Birth and abortion
                and death are frequent topics of conversation. Life for these women is an unending
                succession of child-bearing. They try anything to keep from having so many babies;
                all sorts of drugs, teas and hot baths to bring themselves “around” when they are in
                the “family-way.” When these fail, they try a crude operation, sometimes
                self-inflicted, sometimes performed by a professional abortionist. If they survive,
                then they are considered lucky; but too often they die.</p>
            <p>One terrifically hot mid-summer day I was called to take care of <person
                    reg="Sachs, Sadie">Mrs. Doe</person> (I shall call her by that name although it
                is not her real one) a young East-side mother of twenty-eight. She was married to a
                nice young fellow of thirty-two and they had three little children. They loved each
                other and the babies dearly and were struggling along on the meager wages that
                    <person reg="Sachs, Jake">Mr. Doe</person> was earning.</p>
            <p>But it was the same old story. When I arrived, Mrs. Doe was prostrate on the floor.
                She, knowing of the struggle to eke out a bare living for the little ones they
                already had, was unable to face the prospect of another baby. She had used some
                instrument upon herself, lent to her by a friend.</p>
            <p>For weeks we nursed that little woman as she hovered between life and death. Finally
                we pulled her through. But, though the neighbors were kind and brought her little
                gifts and good things to eat and she was getting better each day, still nothing
                seemed to cheer her. She was depressed and disconsolate.</p>
            <p>Finally one day, after the doctor had pronounced her well and was preparing to leave,
                he told her to be careful and not let herself become pregnant again.</p>
            <p>“<q who="SACSA">I suppose another baby will be my end. Doctor, tell me what can I do
                    to keep from it?</q>” she said.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">Oh, ho</q>,” laughed the doctor in good humor, “<q who="UNK">You can’t
                    have your cake and eat it, too!” Tell Jake to sleep on the roof.</q>” With that
                he went out the door and left us.</p>
            <p>I shall never forget the look on that woman’s face. Tremendous emotions were surging
                within her.</p>
            <p>Conquering her feelings, she turned to me beseechingly, “<q who="SACSA">Tell me the
                    secret</q>,” she begged. “<q who="SACSA">Tell me--and I’ll never breathe it to
                    soul!</q>”</p>
            <p>But what could I tell her? I really did not know myself! Tears filled my eyes and she
                knew that I was sympathetic. But I could do nothing to help her.</p>
            <p>Some weeks later, Mr. Doe called me on the ‘phone. Instantly I knew what had
                happened. On my way I prayed for an accident to overtake me. I could not bear to
                face Mrs. Doe’s reproachful eyes, to see her suffering so needlessly.</p>
            <p>She died ten minutes after I arrived. She never regained consciousness and did not
                know I was there. Her young husband paced the floor in despair, wringing his hands
                and weeping bitterly. Her three little children, left motherless, were sobbing in a
                corner.</p>
            <p>It was then that my whole world--my whole outlook on life changed.</p>
            <p>I walked home in a daze, weary and heart-sick. I walked and walked and all the while
                the resolve within me kept growing stronger and stronger: <emph rend="italics">I
                    will do something to help these women!</emph></p>
            <p>The dawn was rising as I reached my room and I stood at my window and looked out over
                the sleeping city. I seemed to be seeing right into those millions of lives and into
                the very heart of those homes, stretching across the great city. I could feel myself
                the awful fear pressing on these families and causing them such untold misery and
                degradation. Little children forced into factories to help feed the newer arrivals;
                women, always pregnant, afraid, cowed, overworked; men, unable to take care of their
                ever-increasing families, becoming sullen, drunken, sinking lower and lower. Social
                welfare was only a palliative--the root of the evil needed to be reached.</p>
            <p>I threw my nursing bag across the room, pulled off my nurses uniform, and made up my
                mind never again to nurse only women’s bodies while the real cause of their trouble
                was left untouched. Women have a right to know about their own bodies; they should
                know about birth control. I would tell the world what was happening. <emph>I would
                    be heard!</emph></p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <p>It may be well to stop here, and make clear just what birth control is . . . and what
                it is not.</p>
            <p>A couple--shy, young, evidently recently married--stand hesitating at the door of the
                clinic in New York. It is a nice, old-fashioned, and, I think, inviting door leading
                into what was once a large family house. Nothing forbidding, nothing institutional.
                The door opens and they are invited in by a pleasant young woman. They find
                themselves in a cheerful, home-like room, talking things over with a woman
                doctor.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Bride (for indeed she is one, in New York on her wedding trip) is speaking. “<q
                    who="UNK">John and I have such grand plans. We have a little apartment all ready
                    for us back home, and we want to have children as soon as we are able to take
                    care of them. But what we want to know. . . people tell you all sorts of things.
                    . . and talk and talk one doesn’t know right from wrong</q> . . .” She stammered
                and grew confused.</p>
            <p>The kindly doctor was used to young brides. She explained that birth control, rightly
                used, was safe and reliable. She said that, in her opinion, it was better for a
                young couple to have a year or so to get used to each other before the wife became
                pregnant. “<q who="UNK">First learn to know each other as man and woman, as
                    comrades, before you become parents</q>,” she said.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">And can we surely have children when we want them?</q>” asked earnest
                John.</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">Well, no one can answer that</q>,” the doctor replied. “<q who="UNK"
                    >But I can tell you that birth control will do you no harm. Wise parents use
                    birth control except when they want to have a baby. After the baby’s birth, they
                    again use birth control, so that the next baby won’t come too soon</q>.”</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">You mean that people can plan just how many children to have and when
                    to have them?</q>”</p>
            <p>“<q who="UNK">Exactly. Children should not come too close together. They should not
                    come when the mother is not entirely well and strong. They should not come when
                    the father cannot support them</q>.”</p>
            <p>The doctor’s careful explanation may be summed up as follows: There are many things
                to be though of in planning the size of a family, but three are most important.
                    <emph rend="italics">First the mother’s health</emph>: No woman should attempt
                to bring a baby into the world if she has tuberculosis, heart or kidney disease.
                These are illnesses which can usually be cured, if taken in time, and if the
                mother’s strength is not drained by pregnancy. <emph rend="italics">Second, the
                    father’s earnings</emph>: One would think that everyone would agree that a
                family should have no more children than they can support. But many, many couples
                are trying to live on pitifully small incomes, and millions of families among the
                unemployed are unable to get birth control information. <emph rend="italics">The
                    third reason is child spacing</emph>. This means that the children should not
                come too close together, that a woman should have plenty of time to get her strength
                back after pregnancy before another child is on the way.</p>
            <p>Dr. <person reg="Holden, Dr. Frederick C.">Frederick C. Holden</person>, a very wise
                and good doctor, has put this well in one sentence. “<q who="HOLFR">A wise father
                    and mother will have as many children as can be safely carried, safely born and
                    adequately reared</q>.”</p>
            <p>This sums up, in its simplest terms, what birth control IS. What it is not, the
                nurses and doctors at birth control clinics must explain daily with patience and
                sympathy.</p>
            <p>Shortly after young John and Mrs. John had left the clinic, armed with information
                which will give them a good chance for happiness, a frightened, bedraggled woman
                rang the door bell. A child clung to her skirt, she carried a sickly baby in her
                arms. Before the nurse had time even to ask her name, she cried out: “<q who="UNK"
                    >Thees one, and thees one</q>,” pointing to the baby, “<q who="UNK">and mucha
                    plenty more bambino at home. Now comes again bambino, I no can do . . . you feex
                    . . .</q>” and she burst into a flood of Italian, sobbing and rocking to and
                fro.</p>
            <p>A woman doctor who spoke Italian soothed and quieted her and got her story. Husband
                out of work; three children at home--one a cripple. The baby always ailing, six
                months old, and now she was again pregnant. She wanted an abortion. But birth
                control is not abortion, and there was no help for her. She had come too late.
                Earnestly the doctor urged her to be brave, to have this baby, and then come again
                after the baby’s birth, and find out about birth control.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <p>I coined this term <emph rend="italics">birth control</emph> in 1914. I started on my
                life work to bring this knowledge to every married woman who needs it and wants it.
                For twenty-one years I have fought for the right of women to have only wanted
                children, for the right of women to have birth control information. This
                twenty-first Anniversary dinner showed how near--and how far--we are from the
                goal.</p>
            <p>Birth control is an accepted term. Its meaning is clear. It is endorsed by doctors
                and by ministers, by social workers, nurses, thoughtful and intelligent men and
                women the world over. The list of national groups, who have endorsed this work, runs
                to over a thousand. The most recent endorsements of birth control and of our efforts
                to change the Federal law are from the <org>General Federation of Women’s
                    Clubs</org>, and the <org>American Association of University Women</org>. The
                General Federation represents 2,000,000 women and the University group 450,000.</p>
            <p>The East side clinic, about which I have told you, was closed as a “public nuisance”
                and both my sister and I served prison sentences as a result. But as a result, too,
                at my trial, the decision was issued that in New York state birth control
                instruction may be given to a married person by a physician for the “cure or
                prevention of disease.”</p>
            <p>On the strength of this decision, I was able to open a legal clinic in 1923. It has
                been caring for the women of New York ever since, for the young brides and the
                mothers broken down by many childbirths, for women of all nationalities and classes
                and races. It has made possible over ten thousand women, healthier and happier
                lives. This clinic has been a model and an inspiration for other clinics elsewhere.
                Today there are approximately 200 clinics in the United States, taking care of poor
                women who needed birth control advice.</p>
            <p>It would seem that the goal is near. But, though I am thankful that so much has been
                done, though my heart goes out in gratitude to the loyal friends who have helped me,
                the goal is, as I have said, still far off.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <p>What needs still to be done must be done by the nation as a whole, by all women and
                by their husbands, by those who feel as I did on that far-off dawn when I dedicated
                myself to this task.</p>
            <p>The women of America, because of their love for children, want safe and reliable
                birth control information. They have a right to this knowledge. They have a right to
                bring into the world children joyfully conceived and happily awaited, children whom
                they can rear with love and some measure of economic security.</p>
            <p>Today, despite the support of thoughtful and influential people, despite scientific
                findings and the efforts of doctors, ministers and social workers, thousands upon
                thousands of women ask for birth control advice in vain.</p>
            <p>Laws passed over sixty years ago class this knowledge with obscenity and make it
                illegal to send birth control information or supplies through the mail. Bills now
                before <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> will, if passed, make if
                possible for doctors, hospitals and clinics to give birth control advice when
                needed. Then thousands of hospitals and the <org
                    reg="United States Public Health Service">Public Health Service of the United
                    States</org> government could give this information to mothers too poor to go to
                a private physician.</p>
            <p>Here is true democracy. Here is a chance to give to every mother in America the right
                to decide when she should undertake that most noble career, motherhood.</p>
