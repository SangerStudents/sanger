        <head>DUTCH METHODS OF BIRTH CONTROL.</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET H. SANGER</person></byline>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">DUTCH METHODS OF BIRTH CONTROL</head>
            <p>The following methods are taken from the pamphlet published by the <org
                    reg="Nieuw Malthusiaansche Bond,">Neo-Malthusian League of Holland</org>, called
                    "<title type="book">Methods Used to Prevent Large Families</title>," translated
                into English from the Dutch. </p>
            <p>The Council of the Neo-Malthusian League calls attention to the fact that it has for
                its sole object the Prevention of Conception, and not the causing of abortion.</p>
            <p>The Neo-Malthusian League of Holland knows nothing of this pamphlet, and is not in
                any way responsible for its publication. M.H.S.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LEAGUE.</head>
            <p>In the year 1877 Mrs. <person reg="Besant, Annie">Annie Besant </person>and Mr.
                    <person reg="Bradlaugh, Charles">Charles Bradlaugh</person>, two firm and honest
                advocates of the doctrine of <person reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert">Malthus</person>,
                were prosecuted and sentenced to imprisonment for publishing a book entitled "<title
                    type="book">The Fruits of Philosophy</title>," which presented the physiological
                aspects of birth control.</p>
            <p>The trial lasted several days, and aroused a greater interest in the subject than had
                been known since the days of Malthus. The English Press was full of the subject;
                scientific congresses gave it their attention; many noted political economists wrote
                about it; over a hundred petitions were presented to <org>Parliament</org>
                requesting the freedom of open discussion; meetings of thousands of persons were
                held in all the large cities; and as a result, a strong <org reg="Malthusian League"
                    >neo-Malthusian League</org> was formed in <place reg="London, England"
                    >London</place>.</p>
            <p>Interest in the subject did not confine itself to <place>England</place>, however,
                for the following year at an <org>International Medical Congress</org> in <place
                    reg="Amsterdam,Netherlands, the">Amsterdam</place> the subject was discussed
                with great enthusiasm. A paper prepared and read by Mr. <person
                    reg="Van Houten, Samuel">S. Van Houten</person> (later Prime Minister) caused a
                wider interest in the subject, and a year later the Neo-Malthusian League of Holland
                was organized. <person reg="Drysdale, Charles R.">Charles R. Drysdale</person>, then
                President of the English League, attended the Conference. </p>
            <p>As is usual in such causes, many of the better educated and intelligent classes
                adopted the practice at once, as did the better educated workers; but the movement
                had as yet no interest among the poorest and most ignorant. The League set to work
                at once to double its efforts in these quarters. Dr. <person reg="Jacobs, Aletta"
                    >Aletta Jacobs</person>, the first woman physician in <place
                    reg="Netherlands, the">Holland</place>, became a member of the League, and
                established a clinic where she gave information on the means of prevention of
                conception free to all poor women who applied for it. </p>
            <p>Naturally, this action on the part of a member of the medical profession aroused the
                animosity of many of its members against her; but Dr. Jacobs stood firm in her
                principles, and continued to spread the necessary information among the peasant
                women in Holland, in the face of professional criticism and gross
                misunderstandings.</p>
            <p>All classes, especially the poor, welcomed the knowledge with open arms, and requests
                came thick and fast for the League's assistance to obtain the necessary appliances
                free of charge. The consequence has been that for the past twelve years the League
                has labored chiefly among the people of the poorest districts. Dr. <person
                    reg="Rutgers, Johannes">J. Rutgers</person> and <person
                    reg="Hoitsema-Rutgers, Marie">Madame Hoitsema Rutgers</person>, two other ardent
                advocates of these principles, have devoted their lives to this work. Dr. Rutgers
                says that where this knowledge is taught there is a reciprocal action to be
                observed: "<q who="RUTJO">In families where children are carefully procreated, they
                    are reared carefully; and where they are reared carefully, they are carefully
                    procreated.</q>"</p>
            <p>The Neo-Malthusian League of Holland has over 5,000 men and women in its membership,
                and more than fifty nurses whom it endorses.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">THE DISTRICT NURSES.</head>
            <p>These nurses are trained and instructed by Dr. Rutgers in the proper means and
                hygienic principles of the methods of Family Limitation. They are established in
                practice in the various towns and cities throughout Holland. They not only advise
                women as to the best method to employ to prevent conception, but they also supply
                them with a well-fitted pessary, and teach them how to adjust, remove, and care for
                it--all for the small sum of 1 1/2 guilder, or about 60 cents. They work mainly in
                the agricultural and industrial districts, or are located near them; and their
                teachings include not only the method of prevention of conception, but instruction
                in general and sexual hygiene, cleanliness, the uselessness of drugs, and the
                non-necessity of abortions.</p>
            <p>In this country, for a nurse to dare to fit a woman with a pessary would be
                considered a breach of professional rights. In Holland, they know the poor cannot
                pay the physicians, and this simple adjustment is looked upon by the medical
                profession much as they view the nurse administering an enema or a douche.</p>
            <p>I had the pleasure of attending some of the classes where Dr. Rutgers gave this
                course of instruction. I also attended and assisted in the clinics where women came
                to be advised, instructed, and fitted. Many of them came for the first time, and
                though they were unacquainted with any means to be employed, they accepted the
                instructions in a most natural and intelligent manner. Other women came to be
                refitted, and many brought the pessary previously used, to ask questions concerning
                its adjustment.</p>
            <p>There was a determined social responsibility in the attitude of these peasant women
                coming into <place reg="The Hague, Netherlands, the ">The Hague</place> from the
                surrounding districts. It seemed like a great awakening. They look upon a new baby
                in the family much as they look upon the purchase of an automobile or a piano or any
                other luxury where they have no room to keep it, and no means with which to purchase
                it or continue in its upkeep.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt that the establishment of these clinics is one of the most
                important parts in the work of a Birth Control League. The written word and written
                directions are very good, but the fact remains that even the best educated women
                have very limited knowledge of the construction of their generative organs or their
                physiology. What, then, can be expected of the less educated women, who have had
                less advantages and opportunities? It is consequently most desirable that there be
                practical teaching of the methods to be recommended, and women taught the physiology
                of their sex organs by those equipped with the knowledge and capable of teaching
                it.</p>
            <p>The Neo-Malthusian League of Holland endorses, as the most reliable means of
                prevention of conception, the Mensinga pessary (which differs in construction from
                the French or American Mizpah pessary). The nurses also recommend this; but other
                methods are discussed with the patient, and the husband's attitude toward other
                methods considered and discussed. The pessary is the commonest recommendation, as
                giving the most satisfactory results.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">RESULTS.</head>
            <p>It stands to the credit of Holland that it is perhaps the only country where the
                advocates of Birth Control have not been prosecuted or jailed. This does not mean
                there has been no opposition to this propaganda; on the contrary, there is today
                strong opposition by the Church, and only a few years ago, in 1911, when a Clerical
                Government came into power, laws were made against the propagation of these ideas,
                and much of the freedom previously enjoyed by the League was denied it; but on the
                expulsion of the Clerical Government later on, the rights of free speech and free
                press were regained.</p>
            <p>In the year 1895 the League was given a royal decree of public utility, which again
                does not necessarily mean this propaganda is sanctioned by the Government; but the
                laws regarding the liberty of the individual and the freedom of the press uphold it,
                and it is thus that its advocates are not molested.</p>
            <p>The League has thirty sub-divisions, which include all the large cities and towns and
                many of the smaller ones. Over 7,000 pamphlets of the kind printed herein are sent
                out in the Dutch language and several hundred in English and Esperanto each year.
                These are only sent when asked for by the applicant.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt that the Neo-Malthusian League of Holland stands as the foremost in
                the world in organization, and also as a practical example of the results to be
                obtained from Birth Control teaching. Aside from the spreading influence of these
                ideas in <place>Belgium</place>, <place>Italy</place>, and <place>Germany</place>,
                Holland presents to the world a statistical record which proves unmistakably what
                the advocates of Birth Control have claimed for it.</p>
            <p>The infantile mortality of Amsterdam and The Hague is the lowest of any cities in the
                world, while the general death rate and infantile mortality of Holland has fallen to
                be the lowest of any country in Europe. These statistics also refute the wild
                sayings of those who shout against Birth Control and claim it means race suicide. On
                the contrary, Holland proves the practice of anti-conceptional methods leads to race
                improvement, for the increase of population has accelerated as the death rate has
                fallen. There has also been a rapid improvement in the general physique and health
                of the Dutch people, while that of the high birth rate countries,
                    <place>Russia</place> and Germany, is said to be rapidly deteriorating.</p>
            <p>The following figures will suffice to show some of the improvements which have been
                going on in Holland since 1881, the time the League became actively engaged in the
                work:--</p>

            <p>The Neo-Malthusian propaganda in Holland is founded on feministic and economic
                grounds. Birth Control is the pivot around which both of these important movements
                    <unclear>must</unclear> swing. Mr. S. Van Houten, late Minister of the Interior
                for the Netherlands, says:"<q who="VANSA">Wage-slavery exists as a consequence of
                    the carelessness with which the former generation produced wage-slaves; and this
                    slavery will continue so long as the adult children of these wage-slaves have
                    nothing better to do than reproduce wage-slaves.</q>"</p>
            <p>There has been marked improvement in the labor conditions in Holland during these
