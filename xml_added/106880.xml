        <p>Help for the childless couple has been one the research projects in
            the <org reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America"
                >National</org> &amp; <org
                reg="International Planned Parenthood Federation">International
                Planned Parenthood</org> Movement, <add>ever</add>
            <del>in this country as well as in <place>England</place></del>
            since the Movement began. It is interesting to note that both
            Fertility &amp; Infertility Research had little attention by either
            the Medical or Scientific specialists until fairly recently. Today
            they seem to parallel each other in a race to meet the demands of
            our <add>growing</add> intelligent public. The term Birth Control
            used in the Early days of the PP movement signified its principle of
            Control -- (not limitation) of the birth rate by wanting to space
            their pregnancies &amp; to encourage &amp; help <add>childless</add>
            women to become mothers.</p>
