        <byline>BY MARGARET SANGER</byline>
        <q who="STEHA"><p> When <person>Margaret Sanger</person> sailed for <place>Europe</place> to
                escape an indictment in <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>, a voice
                persistently startled her and left her agitated with fear that all was not well with
                the children she had left behind. <person reg="Sanger, Stuart">Stewart</person> was
                13, <person reg="Sanger, Grant">Grant</person>, 8, and <person reg="Sanger, Peggy"
                    >Peggy</person>, 6. And it seemed to be Peggy’s voice calling her. But she had
                felt the momentum and couldn’t stop. Surely those who loved her best preferred that
                she accomplish her task.</p>
            <p> But by a strange coincidence she returned immediately anyway. She learned that
                    <person reg="Comstock. Anthony">Anthony Comstock</person> personally had tricked
                her artist husband into releasing a <rs reg="Family Limitation">pamphlet</rs> which
                was the first and only bit of literature on birth control he ever had given out. She
                heard that <person reg="Sanger, William">William Sanger</person> was facing a term
                in jail. </p></q>
        <p><q who="STEHA">Europe was at war then, the Lusitania had just been torpedoed, and she
                sailed in darkness on an interminable voyage home. She meant to defend her husband
                (she was separated from him then and later was divorced), pick up the children
                quietly and return to <place>England</place>. But Peggy wasn’t well, and died of
                pneumonia shortly after her arrival.</q> “Some people criticize mothers while
            working for a cause or <gap extent="one word" reason="covered over"/> of need to support
            themselves, send their children to a boarding school,”<q who="STEHA"> she said.</q>
        </p>
        <p>“But I say that it is a supreme sacrifice. It is the most unselfish act on a mother’s
            part. It shows a selfless consideration of the child’s good rather than an egotistical
            self-indulgence in sentimentality."</p>
        <p>“Sometimes the maternal hunger got beyond control and I’d catch the first train to the
            school, only to find that the children were happy and content without me. At times, the
            utter loneliness of life seemed too much to bear. I’d come home to my apartment and find
            the same book where I had left it, and the glove where I had dropped it on the floor.
            But the children were happy and that mattered more than my loneliness."” </p>
        <q who="STEHA">
            <p>Turning toward her desk where she kept a copy of her reminiscences to which she gave
                the formidable title, “<title>My Fight for Birth Control</title>,” she opened the
                book to the photograph of her boys and asked us to judge if they looked any the
                worse for their mother’s outside activities. Stewart is a graduate of the Sheffield
                Scientific school at <org reg="Yale University">Yale</org>; Grant studied at <org
                    reg="Princeton University">Princeton</org> and now is attending <org
                    reg="Cornell Medical College">Cornell Medical college</org>. </p>
            <p>A slender woman of medium height, one hardly imagines her strong enough to swerve
                people toward a cause which affects one of the most vital social problems. A child
                among 11 children in her own family but raised by lovable, intelligent parents who
                were very poor, she early associated large families with poverty, unemployment,
                illness, debts and jail. It was this theory which prompted her to study nursing, and
                later to nurse the sick in the slums. </p>
            <p>We argued: </p></q>
        <p>“But, if a majority of mothers who weren’t pressed by the financial urge to earn money
            outside, went out nevertheless, might it interfere with their happiness? They would
            stave off child-bearing on that account.” </p>
        <p>“If they don’t desire children,” <q who="STEHA">she said,</q> “it’s just as well that
            they don’t have them; apparently they haven’t the mother-urge." </p>
        <p> “But among working wives you’ll find that a large majority of them are college-bred
            girls who had been sheltered and disciplined so long that the career or job is just an
            expression of freedom. But they tire of it after a year or two and settle down to a
            complete domestic life.”</p>
