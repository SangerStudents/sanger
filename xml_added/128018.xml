        <p> Last December the <org>American Birth Control League</org> was invited to prepare an
            exhibit for the <name type="conf">Parents’ Exposition</name>, which was held last month
            in the <org>Grand Central Palace</org>, in <place reg="New York, NY">New York
                City</place>. A contract was signed in February; and great care and pains were taken
            by our organization to prepare a dignified, instructive and inoffensive survey of our
            work. On the eve of the opening we received a letter from <person reg="Simon, Robert E."
                >Robert E. Simon</person>, president of the <org>Associated Parents’ Association of
                Greater New York</org>, stating that Dr. <person reg="O'Shea, William J."
                >O’Shea</person>, <add>the superintendent of public schools,</add> had threatened to
            remove the exhibition prepared by the <org reg="New York Board of Education">Board of
                Education</org> if the American Birth Control League were permitted to exhibit.
                <add>Mr. Simon confessed</add> that he was unable to combat such powerful
            opposition, and that therefore our exhibit could not be shown. We then addressed a
            communication to the superintendent of schools, requesting that a committee be appointed
            to suggest changes and improvements which would make our exhibit acceptable. But, as was
            to be expected, this suggestion was refused point blank, and the distinguished
            “educator, ”in newspaper interviews, was quoted as asserting: “<q who="OSHWI">I won’t
                have anything to do with an exhibition that teaches such stuff to our high school
                girls.... I don’t want our girls to hear that sort of stuff while they are under the
                protection of the school system.</q>”</p>
        <p>This muddled confusion of the question, combined with Dr. <add>O’Shea’s</add> a
            completely unauthorized usurpation and abuse of authority, was given widespread
            publicity in the daily press. As usual the attempted suppression of Birth Control
            resulted in making it for several days the focal point of public interest. It also
            showed the intelligent public of New York City that its superintendent of schools,
            affiliated with a <org reg="Roman Catholic Church">Church</org> that is demanding
            broad-mindedness and tolerance among all American voters, in view of the presidential
            aspirations of Governor <person reg="Smith, Alfred E.">Smith</person>, is himself
            constitutionally unable to assume an adult, impartial, or intelligent attitude toward
            one of the central problems of parenthood.</p>
        <p><del>The exposition</del> Arranged primarily <add>to reveal <del>this</del> to</add> for
            the parents of Greater New York, <del>them</del> the social agencies through which they
            might achieve happier homes, better children and wiser parenthood, <add>the exposition
                was therefore</add> was scaled down to <del>the</del>
            <add>
                <unclear>illegible word</unclear>
            </add> intelligence level <del>less than that</del>
            <add>below that</add> of a fourteen-year old. How is it possible to educate parents,
            when educators themselves refuse to exercise their intelligence?</p>
        <p>Despite the yards of newspaper publicity the incident has stimulated, we are too
            experienced in such conflicts to claim a victory. It has required long years of effort
            to educate the police of New York City into an attitude of forbearance and tolerance
            toward Birth Control activities. It has required an almost equally long time to arouse
            the public from its lethargy of indifference into a latently and even a quietly active
            sympathy toward our activities. And now it seems that we must begin to “educate the
            educators.” We have never been cynical enough to believe, <add>as certain observers have
                claimed,</add> that the ordinary school official is the least intelligent and most
            reactionary element in the community. But what are we to conclude after this exhibition
            of bludgeoning bigotry by Dr. O’Shea, and his assistant superintendent (and spokesman)
                <person reg="Campbell, Harold G.">Harold G. Campbell</person>?</p>
        <p>All that these distinguished “educators” wrote or said was based on the fallacious
            assumption that Birth Control was something indecent, something not quite respectable.
            Such an attitude is more <del>subnormal</del>
            <add>restricted</add> in intelligence than <add>that of</add> the most backward child
            placed under what Dr. O’Shea claims is “<q who="OSHWI">the protection of the school
                system.</q>” We wonder if ignorance and intolerance ever furnish any truly adequate
            protection.</p>
        <p>No: we cannot claim a victory. We are willing and ready to renew our fight for toleration
            and understanding all over again; to begin again our ploughing the rocky soil of
            ignorance and misunderstanding, to begin if necessary the education even of those who
            refuse to be educated, but it is difficult to find any weapon sharp enough and subtle
            enough to repair the unjust injuries done to our cause by deliberate misrepresentation
            and aggressive malice. One fact remains as clear as a challenge: American parents must
            beware the menace of placing the political power of their country and of their school in
            the hands of those whose attitude is determined by a Church which develops in its
            children a state of mind at complete variance with the essential spirit of American
            institutions.</p>
        <p>There <add><del>are</del> have been , however, certain</add> compensations for this
            injury <del>that was</del> done to the cause of Birth Control. The courageous letter of
            Mr. <person reg="Macgowan, Kenneth">Kenneth Macgowan</person>, vice-president of the
                <org>Walden School</org>, in resigning from the Parents’ Association and refusing to
            make an address at the exposition, because of the unjust treatment of our League, has
            demonstrated that if hypocrisy and ignorance can usurp authority, there is, on the other
            hand, still active <del>in</del>
            <add>among the parents</add> of our community, a type of dynamic quick-thinking and
            quick-acting intelligence to protest against bigoted censorship. The protest of Mr.
                <person reg="Lasker, Bruno">Bruno Lasker </person>was likewise gratifying,
            indicating as it did the prevalence among a <del>wide</del>
            <add>broad</add> group of New York parents of an enlightened and intelligent attitude
            concerning the central importance of Birth Control <del>illegible words</del> to
            American parenthood <del>illegible words</del>.</p>
