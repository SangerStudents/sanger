        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <div type="section">
            <p>The world picture abroad was dark and confused during 1941. Except for
                    <place>Sweden</place>, information on clinical service on the birth control
                movement in other countries in <place>Europe</place> could not be obtained. Constant
                and relentless pressure on the conquered nations, food rationing and requisition by
                    <place>Germany</place> of supplies from every country overrun resulted in
                lowered birth rates.</p>
            <p>This form of birth control is dsygenic in the extreme; but no sane population policy
                could be adopted as long as Germany dominated Europe, and until world reconstruction
                programs included, as one essential for enduring peace, a consideration of the need
                for solving problems of overpopulation in relation to national resources.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>Australia</place>.--</head>
            <p>Vital statistics for Australia showed a slight rise in the birth rate of 1941 over
                that of 1940, and a sharp increase in the number of marriages, with their rate, 11.8
                per 1,000 population, the highest on record. Established birth control clinics
                continued their work.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="section"><place>Cuba</place>.--</head>
            <p>Efforts to establish birth control centres in the island were stimulated by lectures
                before the <org reg="Cuban Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology">Gynecological
                    association</org> of the island, and publication of a new illustrated pamphlet
                on contraceptive technique, by a leading gynaecologist, received wide circulation
                among the medical profession.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>England</place>.</head>
            <p>Branch clinics of the <org>Family Planning association</org> in the worst bombed
                areas of the provinces had extraordinary escapes from serious damage and were
                carrying on at the close of 1941. Some of the centres in or near
                    <place>London</place> and the southeastern districts were temporarily suspended.
                Headquarters of the association were evacuated to <place reg="Bournemouth, England"
                    >Bournemouth</place> late in 1940, with a small staff at the <place
                    reg="London, England">London</place> office.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>France</place>.--</head>
            <p>Adoption of more drastic regulations against birth control and abortion failed to
                stem the fall in France’s birth rate, nor has increase in family allowances had any
                such result. Food rationing resulted in a drop in the average weight of infants born
                and Germany’s failure to release the 1,500,000 French prisoners held outside France
                tended to further reduce the birth rate.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>Germany</place>.--</head>
            <p>Germany endeavoured to raise its marriage rate by allowing soldiers at the front in
                any country to marry by proxy. Illegitimate births were officially stimulated and
                encouraged. In spite of all regulations against the sale of contraceptives, sales
                continued. Live births in the reich were reported increasing, but figures were
                contrasted with those of 1939. Civil statistics for the first quarter of 1941 showed
                them to be 24.5% less than in the corresponding quarter of 1940, however.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>India</place>.--</head>
            <p>Progress in organization of birth control work was reported to the <org
                    reg="Family Planning Association of India">Family Planning association</org> by
                its organizer in that country. The last census in 1940 credited India with a
                population of 400,000,000, an increase of 18% in 10 years.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>Japan</place>.--</head>
            <p>By official decree a higher birth rate was ordered in Japan in 1941. The objectives
                are a perpetual population increase, so that other nations can be outrivalled in
                quantity and rate of increase, and industry and military manpower maintained. Birth
                control was rigorously suppressed, but in spite of this and of threats and
                inducements, the birth rate did not go up as fast as expected. Infant mortality
                rates, however, increased, and malnutrition was prevalent.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>New Zealand</place>.--</head>
            <p>The <org reg="Family Planning Association of New Zealand">Family Planning
                    association</org> stimulated the passage at many meetings of a resolution asking
                the <person reg="Ferguson, Lindo">dean of the medical school</person> of <org>Otago
                    university</org>, the only medical school in New Zealand, to include a course in
                contraceptive technique in training the students there.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>Norway</place>.--</head>
            <p>All Norwegian birth control centres were closed by the police, following German
                occupation of the country.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>Sweden</place>.--</head>
            <p>The <org reg="Riksf&ouml;rbundet fur Sexuell Upplysning">Swedish Society for Sexual
                    Enlightenment</org> continued work during the year and its <org>Stockholm Birth
                    Control</org> clinic advised many women. The society collected funds to open a
                home for deserted mothers and provide relief for them.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub"><place>Puerto Rico</place>.--</head>
            <p>There was a steady increase in the number of clinic services under the direction of
                the <org><foreign lang="SPA">Association Pro Salud Maternal e Infantil de Puerto
                        Rico</foreign></org>. These services were medically directed, and research
                studies on them were being undertaken to determine rates of effectiveness and
                acceptability of the methods advised. An interdepartmental committee appointed by
                    <person reg="Roosevelt, Franklin D.">President Roosevelt</person> to survey
                Puerto Rico reported that overpopulation was the greatest problem of the island and
                that “birth control should be made a major function of the Insular <org
                    reg="Puerto Rico, Department of Health">Department of Health</org>, as the key
                to the entire health situation in Puerto Rico.”</p>

            <head type="sub"><place>United States</place>.--</head>
            <p><emph>Population</emph>. Final figures of the 1940 census showed an increase of
                almost 9,000,000 during the decade, in spite of ten years of depression and the
                lowest marriage rates in many years. Both marriage and birth rates rose in 1941 and
                forecast was for a birth rate of 18.5 for the year. Number of family units in the
                country increased 16.6% during the decade, though the average number of persons
                declined slightly.</p>

            <head type="sub"><org>Birth Control Federation of America</org>, Inc.--</head>
            <p>Thirty-four state organizations were affiliated with the federation in 1941. The year
                was one of marked progress and increased public support.</p>
            <p>On Oct. 16, simultaneous anniversary observances were held in 32 cities throughout
                the U.S., commemorating the 25th anniversary of the founding of America’s first
                birth control clinic by <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> in
                    <place reg="Brooklyn, NY">Brooklyn</place> in 1916, which was closed as a
                “public nuisance.” Numerous articles in the lay and medical press commented on the
                growth of clinic services and the increasing recognition by public health agencies
                of the importance of contraceptive service in their own programs.</p>
            <p><place>Alabama</place> followed North and <place>South Carolina</place> as the third
                state to include birth control officially in its public health program, and reports
                on the programs in these states were requested by many public health officials in
                other states.</p>
            <p>Field work of the federation was concentrated in the south where population studies
                indicated the greatest need for a program of family spacing, where infant and
                maternal mortality rates are highest, and where high fertility and poverty make
                living conditions most difficult. Prominent citizens of the south held a <org>Third
                    Southern Conference on Tomorrow’s Children</org> and formulated a practical
                program of action.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">Clinical Service.--</head>
            <p>Birth control centres in the United States totalled 637 in Nov. 1941. Of these 118
                were in hospitals, 206 in health departments and 313 in other quarters, while 283
                were supported wholly or in part by public funds. More than 90% of public health
                officers answering a questionnaire stated they were in favour of using federal funds
                for such service.</p>

        <div>
            <head type="sub">Legislation.--</head>
            <p><place>Connecticut</place>: A bill to amend the law and give doctors the right to
                advise patients on contraception, when medically indicated, passed the house but was
                defeated in the senate.</p>
            <p><place>Massachusetts</place>: An initiative petition signed by more than 44,000
                voters was presented to the legislature in the form of a bill. After a hearing, the
                bill was referred by the legislature to the state supreme court, for an opinion on
                its constitutionality, the opposition claiming that a religious issue was involved.
                The court ruled that the bill was purely permissive and that no religious issue was
                a factor in the bill. The bill was later defeated by both houses. The necessary
                thousands of additional signatures were secured to put the question on the ballot in
                1942. The opposition, led by <person reg="O'Connell, William Henry">Cardinal
                    O’Connell</person> of <place reg="Boston, MA">Boston</place>, attempted to
                challenge the legality of the petition and prevent inclusion of the question on the

                schools, state and county medical societies, public health departments, hospitals,
                medical libraries and individual physicians. More than one-fourth of the leading
                medical schools of the U.S. were visited by a medical representative of the
                federation, resulting in the inclusion of contraception in some programs, and in
                others an increase in the time allotted to the subject of contraception.
