        <p>Birth Control will save the world from another and more devastating holocaust such as the
            great war which has left a continent in one vast stretch of want and misery. Enlightened
            minds everywhere are seeing this, while the less awakened among the populations in all
            nations are speedily recognizing this great fact.</p>
        <p>After six months study abroad of various countries from the point of view of birth
            control, I have returned with a stronger conviction than ever of the work we must do, of
            the responsibility that rests upon the shoulders of the American women engaged in
            furthering the ideals of humanity, of a better, stronger civilization, if we ever hope
            to attain that international reconstruction that will establish world peace. </p>
        <p>"Nor am I alone in this belief that it is the action of the women of this country that is
            needed for this. I am happy to be able today to bring you, to bring to the entire
            womanhood of America, a message and a plea from some of <place>Europe</place>'s most
            distinguished scientists, diplomats, and economists. That message is:</p>
        <p rend="blockquote">We agree with the advocates of Birth Control, that not world peace is
            possible without a reduction of the birth rate and immediate action towards its
            international accomplishment. </p>
        <p rend="blockquote">The men and women who have asked me to bring this message to <place
                reg="United States">America</place> for her own salvation are known to you all as
            the finest flower of intellectual, economic and scientific thought in
                <place>England</place>. They include Dean<person reg="Inge, WIlliam Ralph"

        <p>Meanwhile, while <place>Europe</place> is solving this grave problem, what is America doing? We are
            breeding, breeding, breeding, excess numbers--for what? For another condition like that
            of Europe in 1914, with its dingy overcrowded communities that sought in blood-shed an
            outlet and a relief from the tragedy of existence?</p>
        <p>For unless we apply fundamental remedies to these conditions we will fast approach the
            same congested and confused state which may and is likely to produce an outburst of the
            same nature as the European struggle that in four years laid a world in ruin. We shall
            come to find ourselves in the same position as Japan, of whom we read even in the most
            conservative press, the ominous portent of her over-whelming and rising tide of
            population. There are those who even prophesy that a war is looming anew because of
            Japan's struggle to support this overcrowded condition of society. There will be the
            same excuses as those of <place>Germany</place> for her aggressive efforts at
            conquest--a place for her population--but a second disaster will be infinitely more
            terrible and death-dealing.</p>
        <p>Birth Control is the conscious voluntary regulation of the birth rate by scientific means
            that prevents conception. Birth Control has always been in operation. It dates back
            wellnigh to the beginning of time. We see in the study of Nature how she ruthlessly
            limits the population by famine, wars and pestilence. She sweeps the diseased, the
            weakling and the feebleminded to the wall with her great gestures that clean the world
            for the fit and the strong. But we will not allow nature to take her course. If we
            would, we would not have the state of society that we have today. <del>allow nature to
                take her course. If we would, we would not have the state of society that we have
                to-day.</del></p>
        <p>What does humanity do? We, with our ideas and with our humane consideration, we rescue
            the diseased, the feebleminded and the weaklings. We erect enormous institutions for
            them and fill them with their progeny. Our laws are all passed in support of the same
            blind system--the effort to cure rather than to prevent.</p>
        <p>What are the conditions today in the world? Our institutions are bankrupt. Our people are
            dissatisfied with government--distrustful of hollow panaceas for the future. Our
            hospitals, orphan asylums, homes and other places set aside to house the weak, and the
            physically unfit, are crowded and stripped of their efficiency. Disease and weakness is
            crowding upon <del>our</del> the resources of the world. The leaders and thinkers are in
            a maze of confusion and no one knows what is going to happen next.</p>
        <p>How are we going to meet these conditions? By legislation and palliative measures. We
            erect maternity and child welfare centers and exhaust human resources in trying to show
            the mother how to have more children that she does not want. We still continue in all
            our fields of endeavor to work a cure rather than a prevention. We ignore the
            fundamental ill of humanity--overcrowding and increasing the weak--we study conditions
            but make no effort to prevent the same conditions in the future.</p>
        <p>"These conditions are worldwide. I went to Germany for a short time primarily for the
            purpose of investigating the birth strike at <place reg="Munich, Germany">Munich</place>
            and to study the new preventive said to have been invented in 1914, but I remained to
            see much more. I found that the women are the real sufferers of the war. They have
            brought a population into existence today that is even larger than before the war. They
            are bowed down with </p>
        <p>The physicians and the scientists whom I interviewed are still afraid to trust women with
            preventive knowledge. But there is a growing group of scientists, economists and
            thinkers who have recognized that Germany must reduce her population. This is the hope
            of those broken people. They told me that they consider Birth Control the immediate
            salvation of Germany and that the country must cease to dream of world imperialism and
            trade conquests and devote itself to the development of art, science and philosophy. </p>
        <p>"Since there are no laws in Europe against giving preventive information I was able
            during my stay in England and <place>Scotland</place> to impart such information to more
            than 25,000 people, mainly women.</p>
        <p>These women are working women of the '<org>Women's Co-Operative Guild</org>.' There has
            been great opposition to Birth Control on the part of labor leaders for the past forty
            years and I was amazed and delighted at the elemental urge that drove these women to my
            lectures by the thousands in spite of the enmity against it. When I left England to
            return to America I had invitations that would keep me on the lecture platform without
            rest for the next two years. </p>
        <p>Although I feel it was an achievement to have reached those thousands upon thousands of
            women who in turn will impart the information to thousands of others, to me that was not
            enough. I want clinics established in England as well as America. </p>
        <p>I was able to bring together a remarkable group of people in England to work for Birth
            Control. They are drawn from the most advanced scientists, social workers and publicists
            in that country. Among them are: <list>
                <item>Harold Cox </item>
                <item>J.O.P. Bland</item>
                <item>Leonard Reese</item>
                <item>Dr. Marie Stopes</item>
                <item>Edith How Martin</item>
                <item>Sir Lyndon Macassey</item>
            </list> This committee asked me to present a program--with a plan to cut the work in
            England. This plan was accepted. A clinic is to be established in London. Twenty field
            workers, nurses and social workers, are to be sent out to arouse the English people to
            the necessity of immediate action.</p>
        <p>I have returned to America for six months to organize a similar group here, and to
            present a plan for co-operation with England. Let us, as English speaking people unite
            and work together in this great issue. </p>
        <p>We cannot as occidentals, presume to ask the oriental races, of whom it is feared, will
            overrun the earth, to decrease their population while we encourage a high birth rate
            among ourselves.</p>
