        <p>He would shock conservative Christians by his “<soCalled>destructiveness</soCalled>”.</p>
        <p>He would sweep aside current worldly ideals--wealth, national
            greatness, chauvinistic patriotism, economic power, culture, and
            above all selfishness.</p>
        <p>He would discover that after two thousand years of professed
            Christianity, the world had yet to discover the real meaning of
            Love.</p>
        <p>Cynics, sophisticates, scoffers would ridicule His claims. “Old
            Stuff!” they would shout in derision.</p>
        <p>He would be denounced by the ministers of the Orthodox Churches,
            psycho-analyzed by the psychologists, patronized by the scientists,
            persecuted by the professional upholders of American traditions.</p>
        <p>Undiscouraged, he would champion the despised and rejected, the
            disinherited of society. In a flash He would discover that the
            heaviest burden of all the social injustice of the world still falls
            upon women and children.</p>
        <p>And, gradually, suffering Humanity would slowly come to realize that
            instead of destroying its old values He would be creating new
            ones.</p>
        <p>Instead of external wealth, instead of gold hoarded, instead of
            ostentation, He would make us find for ourselves that inexhaustible
            hidden treasure created by selfless Love.</p>
        <p>To men and women would come a glorious revelation that Love leavens
            life with a new joy.</p>
        <p>But this new love would reveal an Earthly Paradise to men, women and
            children, would have nothing in common with that base selfish,
            thoughtless emotion which passes for Love among many today, and
            hurls countless lives to disaster.</p>
        <p>Nor would it be a colorless, anemic sentiment, based upon neurotic
            asceticism. Not at all: it would make “<q who="BIB">of twain one flesh</q>”, It would
            renew bodies as well as souls--and it would teach humanity finally
            and for all time that body and soul are one and indivisible; that
            the supreme happiness in life is not the seizing of one’s own
            pleasure, but in creating <del>joy</del> <add>it</add> for another.</p>
        <p>Women then would no longer find themselves the victims of selfish
            love. They would no longer be trapped biologically. Free and
            fearless, they would progress steadily in emotional
            self-realization. No longer burdened by poverty, by ill-health, by
            an ever-increasing brood of unwanted children, they would discover
            that this new Love creates a new source of life-giving energy. A new
            generation would spring to manhood and womanhood nourished and
            reared by its rays, infinitely more miraculous than those of the
            sun.</p>
        <p>Liberty, strength, ever more liberty, ever more strength, ever more
            love, not merely between man and woman, not merely between parents
            and children, but love for fellow men, love all-embracing for the
            humblest and most distant of human creatures would eventually result
            from these new Teachings. The Brotherhood of Man, the Sisterhood of
            Woman, would produce a Kingdom of God on earth. Nor would these
            seemingly miraculous fruit be for long in appearing.</p>
        <p>His coming would mean a quickening, an acceleration of progress in
            this direction. It would give Humanity a new direction--it would
            turn the eyes of the world away from external, deceptive, empty
            riches and rewards to the neglected Garden of Eden each bears within
            his soul, and which Love, selfless, free, uninhibited Love alone can
            cultivate.</p>
        <p>No new message this--and the great question is: Does it require the
            Second Coming to convince Humanity of its inexorable truth? </p>
