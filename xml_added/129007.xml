        <p>ANNOUNCER: <q who="ANN">Let's Talk It Over with Dorothy Gordon and Margaret
            Sanger.</q></p>
        <p>ANNOUNCER: <q who="ANN">Having two such distuinguisted women on our program today, leads
                me to believe the subject matter has some special significance...</q></p>
        <p>DG: <q who="GORDO">We feel it has. Mrs. Sanger and I want to talk about the contributions
                that some individuals make to civilization.</q></p>
        <p>ANNOUNCER: <q who="ANN">Who, for instance?</q></p>
        <p>DG: <q who="GORDO">I was thinking about <person reg="Ellis, Havelock">Havelock
                    Ellis</person> particularly. We all know he has just passed out of this world. I
                say “this world” because his spirit lives on and will live on for all time. We are
                fortunate in having with us today someone who typifies, to me and to many others,
                that same deathless and timeless quality of the human spirit that was Havelock
                Ellis. I refer to Margaret Sanger--who is uniquely qualified to pay tribute to
                Havelock Ellis, as one who knew and loved and understood him as few have been
                privileged to do. She has consented to share that knowledge with us, and to tell us
                more about that great soul. May I ask you some questions, Margaret?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Certainly, Dorothy.</p>
        <p>DG: <q who="GORDO">When did you first meet Havelock Ellis? And how did it happen?</q></p>
        <p>MS: It was Christmas eve, during the dark days of 1914. . . Many prominent people in
                <place>England</place> were anxious to learn about my battle with the <name
                type="law" reg="United States Penal Code, Section 211">Comstock laws</name>. I had
            already begun my effort to construct a new world of my own dreams on the ideas Havelock
            Ellis had put forth in his works, but to meet that great and universal mind was an
            unhoped for privilege. . . . . and then an invitation to call came from him.</p>
        <p>DG: <q who="GORDO">That must have been an interesting meeting. What happened?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Well, I climbed up the stairs to his apartment in a modest section of <place
                reg="London, England">London</place>, across the Thames, and full of shyness and
            fear and uncertainty, I lifted the huge brass knocker. Ellis himself opened the door. He
            seemed like a God, with his tall, slender figure, and his great shock of white hair, his
            massive head, his wide expressive mouth and deep-set eyes, with their humorous twinkle.
            He welcomed me in. I stuttered with embarrassment but Ellis was silent. I never knew a
            human being could be so silent, and yet remain so poised. Small talk was not possible
            with him. You had to utter only the deepest truths within you. . . With his own hands he
            prepared tea and toast and cakes and we sat before a fire and talked and talked and
            talked . . . . . . . .</p>
        <p>DG: <q who="GORDO">He wasn’t difficult to talk to, was he?</q></p>
        <p>MS: No, indeed. After those first few moments I felt as though I had always known him. I
            began to realize then that the men who are truly great are the easiest to meet and
            understand. Havelock Ellis was entirely unaware of the eminence he had attained. He
            pasted no labels on himself, had no poses, made no effort to impress. He was simply,
            quite unselfconsciously, what he was . . . . . .</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: Was he already well-known at that time?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Yes, his work and fame in the field of sex psychology had already won him universal
            recognition, but he was as indifferent to applause and praise as he was to the abuse and
            criticism that previously had greeted his monumental works in England, forcing him to
            publish them in <place reg="United States">America</place>. Like all great thinkers,
            Havelock was content to live simply and in what many might consider poverty and
            obscurity, refusing to even consider the invitations that poured in upon him to tour and
            lecture in various countries that wished to honor his genius. . . .</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: What a contribution he made to humanity.</q></p>
        <p>MS: Yes, there is no doubt that generations yet to come will honor him as the one who
            opened the spiritual portals of the 20th Century and revealed sex as a spiritual factor
            in the lives of men and women, brining to both alike a better understanding of their
            physical, mental and creative functions. His labors, unique in history, raised this
            question from the obscurity and secrecy where it had been thrust for centuries, and
            lifted it to its proper plane of dignity and science. Nothing human was alien to his
            sympathy. His knowledge was broad and deep; his wisdom even deeper. He never made any
            strident, blatant attempt to cry aloud his message, but yet in ever increasing numbers,
            men and women have paused to listen to his serene voice.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: But he, like yourself, had to face public abuse and criticism, didn’t
                he?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Yes, but here we see a phenomenon as amazing as radio. Despite all the obstacles and
            obstructions that hindered his expression, the legal battles and charges against him,
            his truth filtered through to minds ready to receive it. His philosophy, if it can be
            reduced to its essence, was that happiness must be the fruit of an attitude towards
            life, that it is in no way dependent upon the rewards or the gifts of fortune.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: You speak now of the great scientist and philosopher that he was. I
                feel that our audience would like to know more about Havelock Ellis as his friends
                know him. Wasn’t he exceedingly shy?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Oh very. Yet he loved sauntering through the highways and byways, wherever people
            gather, but his shyness overtook him when he was noticed, and then like a faun in the
            dawn, he would quickly escape and be lost again.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: A faun? That’s interesting, because I remember his eyes had that soft
                look of the faun. . . . . .</q></p>
        <p>MS: Yes, but don’t forget that mischievous twinkle in them too, and his sense of humor,
            and his ever constant memory for the little things that please. . . the kind of olives
            you liked, or the kind of bread or fruit you preferred, or your favorite desert, which,
            by the way, Dorothy, he often made himself.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: With his usual simplicity?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Yes, he was as much an artist in his kitchen, as he excelled in other fields, and we
            all know that many a profound subject or problem was thought through by him while he
            prepared some dish for a fortunate guest.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: You say he excelled in other fields-- meaning?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Yes, he was not only a physician, he was also a poet, and an artist, a philosopher, a
            sociologist, psychologist and scientist, embodying a combined knowledge of all these
            subjects in whatever he wrote or said.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: It interested me especially to see the great love that Havelock Ellis
                had for music, and his knowledge of the Masters in all the arts.</q></p>
        <p>MS: That is true. . . it was all an expression of his great understanding of humanity. He
            was a seeker after truth in all its forms; and he welcomed it wherever he found it,
            believing that truth must be realized and recognized if we are to have a happier
            mankind. He wanted to set mankind free from the inhibitions, prejudices and the
            ignorance which have caused so much unnecessary hardship and suffering almost from the
            dawn of history.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: He was so shy, and yet he loved people, didn’t he?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Yes, he loved the world and particularly the old and mellow things of life. He would
            roam and saunter about the old parts of <place reg="Paris,France">Paris</place>, and he
            especially loved <place>Spain</place>, with its old and winding streets, its people with
            their old customs, their folk-lore and their joyous dancing--that was why you, Dorothy,
            with your merry impersonations of these songs and dances, struck such a sympathetic
            chord with him. . . His book, “<title type="book">The Soul of Spain</title>” remains one of the best
            ever written about that now unhappy country.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: Yes, that was a wonderful book, and also his “<title type="book">Dance of Life</title>.” He was
                such a prolific and such a varied writer. How could one man accomplish so much in
                just a lifetime?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Because he did not scatter his ideas and energies as most of us do, but captured them
            as they were created.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: How did he capture them?</q></p>
        <p>MS: He carried a little notebook, and regardless of where we were, whether in a street
            car, walking together, or in a restaurant, he would suddenly stop to jot down his ideas
            or impression, later storing them away in little envelopes. By the time the envelope
            became too bulky for comfort, a book had emerged!</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: There’s your sense of humor, one of the things that Havelock Ellis
                loved about you, so was your laughter. . . in fact, one of the greatest compliments
                I have ever received in my life was to have him say that I reminded him of you,
                because I too laughed a lot with him. . . but tell me, Margaret, you met Havelock
                Ellis in 1914. American women did not have the vote then. You were an ardent
                feminist. What was his attitude towards “votes for women” and feminism?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Havelock Ellis helped to usher in a new day of womankind. To all his great gifts of
            scientific investigator, philosophic thinker, poet, and literary artist combined in one,
            was added a peculiarly sympathetic insight into the nature and needs of women. He threw
            the weight of his vast knowledge and influence into advancing the cause of women’s
            freedom, and to women everywhere he seemed a heaven-sent liberator. But he believed
            whole-heartedly in a 50-50, give and take basis, and that women were as equal to men, as
            men were to men. In all of our relationship, there was never any catering, any inference
            that women belonged to the so-called weaker sex, or that they were inferior in any way.
            He believed that women should pay for their own requirements through the efforts of
            their own minds and brains just as men do. Unless I was especially invited to lunch or
            dinner with him, I never imposed but always paid my own share of expenses, whether for
            carfare, in a restaurant, or for a taxi.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: That reminds me, of our <person reg="Unknown">mutual friend</person> who wanted to lunch with
                Havelock regularly. . . tell us the story, you know the one I mean.</q></p>
        <p>MS: Oh yes, this friend wanted to set a certain day once a week, or once every two weeks,
            to lunch together in London with Havelock, just to keep that close contact of the mind.
            . . But Ellis replied that anything of the spirit could not be hedged in by the
            limitations of time, and days in the week. . . He would rather have their meetings a
            spontaneous desire and a spontaneous joy, than a regulated duty.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: Well, with ideas like those, what did he think about marriage? Did he
                believe in that?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Most certainly. But he was wise enough to know that if a marriage is to remain
            strong, there must be freedom, freedom for both individuals, the man and the woman. In
            order to attain his freedom and to keep his own identity and to allow his wife, <person
                reg="Ellis, Edith">Edith</person>, to develop along her own lines, they maintained
            two households. He had an apartment in London, she lived on a farm and made farming
            pay.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: Tell us something about Mrs. Ellis.</q></p>
        <p>MS: Edith Ellis was a vivacious, charming, energetic woman with a mind of her own,
            practical and capable as well. She ran this farm in <place reg="Cornwall, England"
                >Cornwall</place>, but had always ready a suite of rooms for her husband. There she
            kept his special books, his special clothes and personal belongings, and flowers,
            blooming and fresh always, in his room, where he was free to go and come any time that
            he wished. On the other hand, he kept a suite of rooms for her in his apartment in the
            city with her special city and evening clothes, her special books and flowers, and a
            cheery fire ever ready to greet her. They believed that the way to keep their love alive
            in marriage was to be ever alert in the little things, courtesies, considerations, and
            to continuously woo each other as they did in courtship. It was a beautiful friendship,
            a continuing courtship until her death in 1916. He lived what he believed. His
            principles and theories were put into practice. . . and they worked.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: Havelock Ellis influenced you and your own special work a great deal,
                did he not?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Oh yes, he guided my early studies and directed my reading for a year and a half in
            that famous historical spot, the <org>British Museum</org>. Regularly each day we met in
            the reading room, and he mapped out lines of study for me to follow. He believed so
            strongly in my case that he wanted to see me avoid all possible mistakes. I have never
            felt about any person as I do about Havelock Ellis. I’d developed a reverence, an
            affection, and a love which have strengthened with the years. To know him has been a
            bounteous privilege; to claim him my friend the greatest honor of my life.</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: How grateful I am, that thru you, Margaret, I also had the privilege
                of meeting that great spirit. . . . The World will miss him, and we, his friends,
                feel very sad. Is there anything that can help to make his loss a little less
                poignant?</q></p>
        <p>MS: Yes, we who loved him, must be grateful that he has been released from the increasing
            pain and physical limitations of these latter years; that he had made the world
            infinitely richer by his presence in it; that he has become part of the heritage of all
            mankind; and lastly, we can draw strength, and courage, and inspiration from his own
            sublime statement, written to a friend during an almost fatal illness some years ago. He
            wrote: “<q who="ELLHAHavelock Ellis">I find I remain serene--even cheerful. For some years
                past I have accommodated my arrangements to Death and guided my activities
                accordingly, even though I may not yet have completed everything I planned of my
                Day’s work in the world. My faith has carried me so far, and will accompany me to
                the end. Death is the final Master and Lord. But Death must await my good pleasure.
                I command Death because I have no fear of Death. . . . but only Love.</q>”</p>
        <p>And so it proved. The cable that came to me from Madame <person reg="Cyon, Francoisee"
                >Francoisee Cyon</person>--that dear and devoted friend who was with him when he
            died, read:</p>
        <p>“<q who="CYOFR">Havelock passed on quietly Saturday night. It was beautiful.</q>”</p>
        <p><q who="GORDO">DG: Yes, the passing of Havelock Ellis was as beautiful as his living.
                Thank you, Margaret Sanger, for bringing us your lovely memories of him. They will
                live on just as he and you will both live on in the lives of generations to
                come.</q></p>
