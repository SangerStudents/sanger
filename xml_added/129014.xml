        <head>MAGNETATION METHODS OF BIRTH CONTROL</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET H. SANGER</person></byline>
        <div type="section">
            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>In the previous pamphlets, “<title>English Methods of Birth Control</title>” and
                    “<title type="book">Dutch Methods of Birth Control</title>,” one finds a
                duplication of the methods given in the first pamphlet, “<title type="book">Family
                    Limitation</title>.” The French methods of Birth Control are so nearly the same
                that I have decided not to duplicate these again, but to give instead a list of the
                books and pamphlets issued by the <org reg="Generation Consciente">French
                    League</org>, and, also cuts or pictures of some of the articles they have for
                sale at their headquarters, 27 Rue de la Duée, <place reg="Paris, France"
                    >Paris</place>. These will be found at the end of this pamphlet. </p>
            <p>I also find that the methods used to control births in <place>Germany</place>,
                    <place>Italy</place>, <place>Spain</place>, <place>Belgium</place>,
                    <place>Norway</place>, <place>Sweden</place>,<place> India</place>, <place
                    reg="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">Russia</place>, and
                    <place>Japan</place> have all been greatly influenced by the <org
                    reg="Malthusian League">English</org> and <org reg="Nieuw Malthuiaansche Bond"
                    >Dutch Neo-Malthusian League</org> (the two oldest Leagues). To give further
                national methods would be only a waste of time and material, and would add nothing
                to what has already been given. This does not mean that there are not many other
                mechanical devices. There are numerous ones; but I still find that there is nothing
                better, safer, cheaper, or more convenient than the pessary mentioned in “<title
                    type="book">Family Limitation</title>.” </p>
            <p>In France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Sweden there are strong Neo-Malthusian
                movements advancing the Birth Control theories by lectures, literature, and
                practical means. In Russia, Japan, India, and <place reg="United States">United
                    States</place> there have been recently feeble attempts to establish Birth
                Control movements; but as yet they have remained embryonic.</p>
            <p>I have decided to close this series of pamphlets with the following explanation of
                the Magnetation method, and feel that I have said all that I can say of interest on
                Birth Control methods. I have gladly donated my mite toward what I consider to
                women’s economic, social, and sexual freedom.</p>

            <head type="sub">Magnetation Method of Birth Control.</head>
            <p>Before closing this series of pamphlets on the practical methods of Birth Control, I
                feel in justice to the many readers and subscribers of the <title type="journal"
                    >Woman Rebel</title> who inquired about the theories of Magnetation, Male
                Continence, Sedular Absorption, Karezza, and <title type="book">Zugassent’s
                    Discovery</title>, that this series would not be complete without giving at
                least a general idea of these theories and their practice.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that the magnetation theory had its best and longest
                practice, as well as its beginning, in America, under the title Male Continence.
                This method was practiced for over forty years by a group averaging 130 men and 150
                women known as the <org>Oneida Community</org>. They occupied a part of the old
                reservation of the Oneida Indians in <place>New York State</place>, and lived in a
                harmonious and prosperous form of Communistic society. <person
                    reg="Noyes, John Humphrey">John Humphrey Noyes</person> was the head and founder
                of the group. Through personal experience and prolonged study, he discovered the
                theory of male continence. Since that time many others have come forward with the
                    <emph rend="italics">same theory</emph> under various names. Almost without
                exception, each advocate has injected some kind of religion into it. The Oneida
                Community was particularly a religious sect, and <person reg="Stockham, Alice B."
                    >Alice B. Stockham</person>, the author of <title type="book">Karezza</title>,
                was a fervent religionist. However, aside from this, there are fundamental truths in
                the theory which bear thinking about and should not be discarded without some
                consideration. In view of the thousands of testimonials of the healthful results of
                the practice of these theories, I present these methods like that of the others, and
                for convenience shall classify them all under one head, “Magnetation.”</p>
            <p>There are thousands of men and women who object to the practical and mechanical means
                of Birth Control, who feel that the pessary, condom, and douche are gross and
                sordid, and take away the artistic and spiritual beauty of the act. It is those whom
                the magnetation method will interest most. There are others who will claim that this
                method is “not satisfying,” and can find no enjoyment in its practice. But so are
                there thousands of men and women who can pass a beautiful painting and receive no
                inspiration from it, or listen to a charming selection on a musical instrument and
                receive no emotion from it. So are there many whose natures are not so constructed
                that they can enjoy or benefit by this method. There is no doubt that the successful
                attainment of this method is dependable upon a fine spiritual bond between the two
                who enjoy its practice. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">THE THEORY</head>
            <p>The advocates of the magnetation method ask you to first analyse sexual intercourse.
                They claim that you will recognise in it two distinct acts, <emph rend="ital"
                    >i.e.</emph>, the social (or amative) and the propagative. Those who practice
                the magnetation method content themselves with and prefer the social act, unless the
                procreative act is desired. It is usually held that the sexual organs have <emph
                    rend="ital">two</emph> distinct functions, viz., the urinary and the
                propagative. The advocates of the magnetation theory claim that the sexual organs
                have <emph rend="italics">three distinct functions</emph>, viz., urinary,
                propagative, and amative -- <emph rend="italics">i.e.</emph>, they are conductors
                firstly of urine, secondly of semen, and thirdly of social magnetism. Each one
                separate and distinct in itself. </p>
            <p> The organs of propagation are physiologically distinct from the organs of union in
                both sexes. The testicles are the principal organs of reproduction in the male, and
                the uterus in the female. Sexual conjunction of male and female no more involves the
                discharge of semen than of the urine. The discharge of semen, instead of being the
                main act of sexual intercourse, is really the sequel and termination of it. Sexual
                intercourse pure and simple is the conjunction of the organs of union, and the
                interchange and flow of magnetic influences through that conjunction. The seminal
                discharge can be voluntarily withheld in sexual intercourse, or it can be produced
                without sexual intercourse, as in masturbation, which demonstrates the fact that the
                discharge of the semen, and the pleasure associated with its discharge, is not
                social, since it can be produced in solitude: it is a personal and not a social
                act.</p>
            <p>The physiological analysis of the procreative act shows that the pleasure of the act
                is not produced by contact and interchange of life with the female, but by the
                action of the seminal fluid on the internal nerves of the male organ. The desire and
                that which satisfies it are both within the man, and may be obtained without sexual
                intercourse. The amative function, or the simple union of two persons, is a distinct
                and independent function, giving a medium of magnetic interchange superior to that
                gain through reproductive function. it is the presence of the seed abd not the
                absence of it that makes the bull superior to the ox, and it is the stimulating,
                retaining, and absorbing the semen in the man, and directing it into other creative
                channels, which make the amative act of greater benefit and more healthful and
                vitalising than the procreative act. </p>
            <p>Most of us know that creative energy expressed through the sexual nature is an
                instinct to perpetuate life; that it has its origin in and is co-existent with life
                itself; that it is the power back of all purposes and plans; that it is the
                self-pushing force that gives the individual the ability and desire to do and to
                perform; that it is the impelling factor and inventive genius in all man’s
                handiwork. That this force operates in the multiplication of atoms and molecules, in
                the attraction of germ to sperm cells. The process of growth and fulfilment of
                functions is propelled by this energy, which is operative throughout all Nature. It
                is the force back of and expresses itself through the physical life of man and
                animal.</p>
            <p>Atoms, cells, and plants are unconscious of this force, and animals are conscious of
                it only in a slight degree. But man is conscious of this energy, and is capable of
                developing a greater consciousness of it and of its operation and utilization to a
                remarkable degree. Like the engineer who masters the engine by his knowledge of its
                construction and the force that runs it, so can man master this creative energy and
                direct it where he wills. Creative life can be expressed in other ways beside
                parenthood.</p>
            <p><person reg="Emerson, Ralph Waldo">Emerson</person> says, “<q who="EMERA">Work your
                    passion up into poetry.</q>” Passion is the sign of creative power; it is the
                voice of creative life. If it were understood and its powers realized, it would be
                elevated and worshipped instead of lowered and debased, as the Comstocks would have
                us do. As creative energy becomes understood and applied, men and women will grow in
                strength of character and in strength of love, and will naturally devote these
                powers to the interests and development of the human race.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">THE PRACTICE</head>
            <p>Each of these theories involves sedular absorption through intercourse without
                culmination. No discharge is allowed, but by a superior control is retained, thereby
                making the act an amative (love) act, and uplifting it from an exhaustive, abrupt
                fertilizing function into a quiet magnetic charm, producing health and increased
                happiness.</p>
            <p>The act of sexual intercourse has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Its beginning or
                first stage is simply the presence of the male organ in the female. The middle or
                second stage is a series of reciprocal motions. The end or third stage is the
                ejaculatory crisis, or the termination of the act. The advocates of male continence,
                Zugassent’s discovery, sedular absorption, and magnetation claim that the whole
                process up to the third stage is entirely voluntary and can be stopped at any point.
                It is compared to a stream in the three conditions of a fall, a course of rapids
                above the fall, and still water above the rapids. The boatman may decide if he will
                remain in still water or venture down the rapids, or run his boat over the fall.
                They contend that experience will teach him the wisdom of remaining where the rowing
                is easy, unless the object is worthy of going over the falls. Karezza advises to
                content onself with simple presence in the first stage until the magnetic thrill
                passes off. They are all similar and all aim at the same result. I head them under
                one method - "<q>magnetation.</q>”</p>
            <p>Those who practice claim the highest possible enjoyment, with no loss of vitality and
                a perfect control of the fecundating power. Its practice greatly involves the art of
                love by a prolonged intercourse preventing that which puts an end to intercourse -
                the ejaculation. The seminal fluid, it is claimed, has an immense immanent value;
                and if kept in the system and magnetized, and reabsorbed by the blood, adds
                enormously to a man’s mental and magnetic force, which through the ordinary sexual
                act is constantly being expended. That its practice by some men will be difficult
                there can be no doubt; but it can be no more difficult or need a greater power of
                control than that required of the man in the act of “<q>coitus interruptus</q>”
                (withdrawal). Those who practice magnetation claim that it is far removed from
                “repelling asceticism”; that it gives ample exercise to the affections, and
                opportunity for the exchange of sexual magnetism; but that its greatest benefit is
                that its practice conduces to a higher love development. It is the attainment of
                this control that raises the sexual passion in man and woman to its proper place by
                the side of music and poetry. </p>
            <p>The strongest objection which is put forth against its practice is that it is
                    “<q>unnatural</q>”; that it is unauthorized by the examples of other creatures
                of the animal kingdom, and therefore must be wrong. But the answer comes that
                cooking, wearing clothes, and all modern life is far removed form natural living;
                and were we to remain in close adherence to Nature, we would go on all fours and
                remain dumb. </p>
            <p>When we realize we are living in an age when nearly all departments of life have been
                greatly modified and advanced by recent discoveries of steam, electricity, the
                telephone, telegraphy, the microscope, and other agents of enlightenment, is it not
                surprising that there has been almost no discovery or improvement in the vital
                department of the sex relations? The explorer, the pioneer, the discoverer may
                pursue his way into every department of life, and return to lay his riches at the
                feet of Science, Art, or Invention; but woe to him who dares to explore that shaded
                valley of sex. No matter how pure the motive, or what agony and miseries one sought
                to alleviate, dungeons, persecutions, slanders, and jails await him who ventures to
                bring treasures from its hidden depths. Yet there is no other department of life
                which needs so much instruction and education as the sex department.</p>
            <p>A healthful sexual stimulation has a beneficial effect on both men and women,
                especially when the loved one is accessible and some demonstration of sexual feeling
                allowed, as in the restrained yet ardent caresses of an affianced pair. Here we
                often see not only the happiest but the most productive and healthful period of a
                man’s life. It is said this is particularly true of man’s intellectual
                activities.</p>
            <p>We see a year later this same happy pair experience a great falling off in their
                affection. Women have experienced this so often that they begin to hate the sexual
                relation, and look upon the act either with fear of pregnancy or with an
                unconquerable loathing. Of course, a great deal of this aversion which women
                experience is the result of their former training. The girl is taught before
                marriage that the act is a most degrading thing, and is told that it is the
                accomplishment of this one thing for which man desires her before marriage.
                Afterwards all is supposed to be changed. She is expected to have an entirely new
                philosophy as soon as the marriage certificate is in her hands. The average young
                man knows little of the art of love, and is consequently unably to beautify their
                relations or to teach her a new psychology. The first year is spent in secret misery
                on her side, and ruptures and misunderstandings between them both. The average woman
                will tell you she loves to be caressed and to express her affection for her husband,
                but could be quite satisfied without intercourse. This is especially true of the
                intellectual woman, who is acknowledging her lessening interest in the sex relation,
                and even repulses affectionate demonstration, fearing it must terminate in sexual
                intercourse (mainly the fear of pregnancy). </p>
            <p>Surely this is something to be squarely faced by every intelligent man and woman, and
                serious enough to deserve our untiring interest. Something must be wrong. What is
                it? Does this theory offer a solution to any? It may. Nearly all women who practice
                it testify to its benefits, while few men complain of it. Those who do, say that to
                control the ejaculation to-day means a seminal loss later during sleep. The
                advocates, however, say this will occur at first, but after the organs become
                accustomed to their new functions this will wear off, and there will be no seminal
                loss. </p>
            <p>All men in the Oneida community realized that this control was a necessary attainment
                if they would be regarded with favor by the women in the group. Its accomplishment
                was necessary to their mutual happiness, and they had to learn it. If there is a
                method which in practice expresses the highest mutual affection and reveals one’s
                own strength and power, then by all means let mankind know it.</p>
            <p>There is no earthly reason why men and women should not study the laws of sex
                expression as any other science is studied, and it should be a study not only
                intellectual, but of experience and adjustment. If, as is claimed, the experience of
                this method must be practiced on a higher plane of thought than the purely physical,
                then certainly it must tend toward a finer companionship and understanding between
                men and women than the fleeting physical gratification prevailing at present. If
                there is anything which controverts the traditional uncleanliness previously
                attached to the sex relation, if there is anything which brings a blending of body
                and spirit or an ennoblement of the character of the individual, then by all means
                let us have it in its fullest detail, and let this revolting ignorance and prudery
                holding sway over men and women’s minds so long be swept away for all time. Let us
                have light, through discussion, experience, and adjustment. </p>
            <p>There are few men who desire to expose the object of their affection to the burden of
                bearing children faster than her health will permit. They realize a woman’s strength
                is greatly undermined and her beauty and grace fast ebbing away; but ignorance and
                tradition have him in their grip. He knows nothing about the means to prevent it,
                and allows the one he loves best to wither and fade before his eyes.</p>
            <p>It is especially necessary for the woman to be free from the mental dread of
                pregnancy. There is nothing so productive of nervous disorders or so likely to
                decrease the sexual attraction or magnetation as fear and anxious thought. Perfect
                confidence in the man’s ability to control himself is essential to the perfection
                and desired results of these methods. Just as one begins, so can one develop. Young
                men and women about to enter alliances and desirous to establish a lasting affection
                and higher bond between themselves can easily put this method into practice and
                control the sex functions. The more magnetic the individual, the greater the sex
                attractions between those two who love, and the stronger the bond will grow between
                them, through this “<q>magnetation</q>” method.</p>
            <p>The expression and adjustment of all theories is so largely personal that special
                regulations can scarcely be given. The road to science and the great natural laws
                are discovered through experience: there is no education but that of experience.
