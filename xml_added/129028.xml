        <head>MOTHER INDIA AS I SAW HER</head>
        <byline>BY <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET
            SANGER</person></byline>
        <p>I am rather appalled at the idea that I should even think of speaking
            to you tonight on “Mother India As I Saw Her,” for after all I was
            in <place>India</place> only nine weeks. But during that time I
            traveled over 10,000 miles and had the good fortune of being the
            state guest in several different states and provinces. It is said
            that one is never a prophet in his own country and must often go
            very far from home in order to be received by ministers, governors,
            mayors, and other officials high in command in their communities.
            Certainly I have never encountered such hospitality and friendliness
            as I found in India, nor such kind-liness and gratitude.</p>
        <p>I was invited to come to <place>India</place> to address the <org
                reg="All-India Women's Conference">All India Women's
                Conference</org>, and it was my hope that by appearing before
            this group, which represents ten million women, and be securing the
            passage of a resolution in support of birth control, I might give
            impetus to the birth control movement in that country.</p>
        <p>Although I have attended many conferences during the past twenty or
            twenty-five years, I can truthfully say that I have never been at a
            conference of women where I had more surprises, where I had to
            reexamine my own values of life, and where I as so impressed by the
            confidence, the diplomacy, and the courtesy with which the women
            managed their affairs. This may seem a rather strange thing to say,
            because we in <place reg="United States">America</place> think that
            no other women in the world know as much about organization as we
            do. But The All India Women's Conference was a group of women, a
            large number of whom had been in retirement--in Purdah--all their
            lives. Numbers of them had, from early puberty, been kept away from
            any contact with the outside world. I found that many of these women
            were appearing in public perhaps for the first time in their lives,
            were speaking not only to the women but to the men, and doing it
            extremely well. I was especially delighted because in this early
            period of their emancipation Indian women have struck directly at
            the roots of one of their greatest problems--that of controlling
            fertility, and have taken a stand on birth control.</p>
        <p>These women appreciated, as have no women in the Western World with
            the exception of the Scandinavian, that fighting for and obtaining
            the vote was insignificant as compared with fighting for--and
            obtaining--knowledge about their own bodies and freedom to shape
            their own destinies. These fine, modest women dared to come out of
            their seclusion and demand <del>this</del>
            <add>the</add> knowledge which would free them from the bondage of
            their biological slavery. The idea has been handed down for hundreds
            and perhaps thousands of years that the ideal existence for all
            women is to have large numbers of children and to have them as fast
            as they could be born--all to the glory of woman and the family. Not
            only has this been true in India, but also in <place>Japan</place>
            and <place>China</place> and in other parts of the
                <place>Orient</place>. The birth of a boy is highly desirable,
            and not until a woman has presented her husband with a son, even
            though in doing so she may lose her life, does she feel that she has
            fulfilled her mission as a wife.</p>
        <p>I was encouraged to find that the women who came to this Conference
            have gone into the great fundamental question of birth control with
            keenness and thoroughness--even into the economic, sociological,
            biological, legislative, historical, and spiritual aspects of the
            subject. Though they have discarded the idea that it is necessary
            for a woman to have a child every twelve months, they realize that
            having a family is to fulfill the destiny of a normal woman. I
            believe that the women of America feel the same way about having
            children.</p>
        <p>The opposition, to my surprise, was much the same as we find in this
            country and in <place>Europe</place>. It came not from the Hindus,
            nor the Mohammedans, nor the Parsees, but from the <org>Roman
                Catholic Church</org>. In <place reg="Madras, India"
                >Madras</place>, I found that <person>one of the
                priests</person> had called public attention to the fact that
                “<q who="UNK">another America woman</q>” was on her way to
            India. He recalled that <person reg="Mayo, Katherine">Katherine
                Mayo</person> had betrayed the trust placed in her and written a
            book containing many misrepresentations. He warned them to beware of
            this second woman who was coming not only to “<q who="UNK"
                >betray</q>” them, but also to break up their homes. The same
            old arguments...<add>after a generation of actual proof to the
                contrary.</add> Truly it seemed strange to find them
                <add>cropping up</add> in India.</p>
        <p>I am glad to say that this did not stop the Indian women from
                <del>attending</del>
            <add>adopting the resolution at</add> the Conference. They came from
            all over the country and in large numbers<add>, and</add> many came
            who wanted to know especially about birth control. They came
            bringing their babies and children, and nurses to take care of them.
            One of the most unusual sights was to see the children playing
            outside the Conference in the courtyard and the women nursing their
            babies in the Conference. To witness this was indeed a new
            experience for me.</p>
        <p>When the Birth Control Revolution was presented, Her Highness, the
                <person reg="Sethu Lakshmi Bai">Maharani of Travancore</person>,
            presided, and it is noteworthy that this was only the second time
            she had ever appeared at a public meeting in her own state and
            country, though she had appeared in public many times in Europe. Yet
                <place reg="Travancore, India">Travancore</place> is a state
            where they still have the matriarchal system of delegating
            power--that is, the power is handed down through the women. The
            Maharani's position had come from her mother and will go on to her
            children through her. It was a wonderful experience to see “Mother
            India” in all her glory. The Maharani entertained the women of the
            Conference at a garden party such as we in the West read of in the
                <title>Arabian Nights</title>. The beauty of the gardens, the
            colors, the flowers, the lights, the playing fountains--all this
            simply entranced me, and it was enchanting to be close to so much
            beauty. The women wear jasmine flowers in their hair and around
            their necks, and garlands of jasmine are given to the visitors, when
            they arrive and when they depart.</p>
        <p>The spirit of friendliness, which is characteristic of India, was
            apparent when the women considered the Birth Control Resolution.
            Their attitude toward each other, and especially towards those women
            who opposed the Resolution, was one of sympathy and cooperation.
            Those who were against it were given two opportunities to speak,
            while those in favor were given only one. I was not so sure that
            this was true democracy, and thought perhaps a fifty-fifty
            arrangement would have been somewhat fairer. I was amazed to find
            that most of the opposition came from Europeans and from Christian
            missionaries, and not from Indian women themselves. Miss Smith, Miss
            Jones, Miss this and Miss that, spoke in no uncertain terms of the
            dire effects of birth control and of the licentiousness and
            immorality within the marriage state which would follow its use.
            Finally, an Indian woman arose and said: “<q who="UNK">I am the
                mother of five children; every woman who has spoken in favor of
                this Resolution today is the mother of from three to five and
                even nine children. I have never heard so much about the 'lusts’
                and 'passions’ of men as we have heard this morning from the
                unmarried women</q>.” Everyone saw the humor fo her remarks, and
            immediately the tension was relaxed. The Resolution was passed. It
            was most constructive, and recommended that doctors and public
            health organizations disseminate contraceptive information.</p>
        <p>Now I want to tell you a little about “Mother India As I Saw Her.”
            The population problem, of course, interested me a great deal. Most
            of our time in India was spent in the large cities, but in
            travelling we went through many of the outlying districts and
            villages. We went from <place reg="Bombay, India">Bombay</place> to
                <place reg="Wardha, India">Wardha</place> to see <person
                reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K.">Mahatma Gandhi</person> and then to
                <place reg="Calcutta, India">Calcutta</place> and then to see
            the <place>Himalayas</place>. We came back to Calcutta to visit the
            poet, <person reg="Tagore, Rabindranath">Dr. Tagore</person>, and
            then on to <place reg="Benares, India">Benares</place>, <place
                reg="Allahabad, India">Allahabad</place>, <place
                reg="Delhi, India">Delhi</place>, and <place reg="Baroda, India"
                >Baroda</place>, and again back to Bombay. In this way, we saw a
            great deal of the country, particularly <del>in</del>
            <add>from</add> railroads and in railway stations, and we met many
            people who come in delegations to meet <del>the</del>
            <add>our</add> trains. (<person reg="Phillips, Anna Jane">Anna Jane
                Phillips</person>, who volunteered her services <add> and
                experiences to go with me and help, travelled with me.</add></p>
        <p>Population is, I think, one of India's greatest problems. <del>The
                population of India, of course, is very large.</del> There are,
            we are told, some 350 millions of people, with an increase of
            thirty-four millions in ten years and of twenty millions in the last
            two years. I do not believe that this last figure is <add>an actual
                increase. It resulted from the fact that</add> when the census
            prior to the last one was taken, the noncooperative movement was at
            its height and many of the people did not register. This
                <del>fact</del> alone could account for perhaps some fifteen or
            twenty millions, which would increase the total at the time of the
            last census, when the noncooperative movement had subsided.</p>
        <p>One of the recent aims of the public health program has been to
            lessen infant mortality and to raise the age of marriage. The
            Women's Conference passed a resolution to put teeth into the laws
            prohibiting child marriages by urging the penalty of a large fine
            when parents allowed young boys and girls below the age of fifteen
            to marry. But that very act they are going to <add>continue the
                birth rate,</add> decrease infant mortality, and at the same
            time save the lives of women. This will, of course, tend to increase
            the population. People are also being saved from famine, small pox
            epidemics, plagues, and are being helped to live longer.</p>
        <p>Infant mortality, however is still high--far too high. Statistics
            show that one-fifth of the babies born do not live until their first
            birthday and one-half of them do not live until the age of five. The
            are three factors affecting infant mortality: first, the economic
            condition of the family, i.e. the father's wage; second, the spacing
            of the children; and third, where the child is placed in the family.
            We are familiar with the first two factors, but let us consider some
            statistics with regard to the third, and we shall be very much
            surprised to find how smiliar they are to our own figures in the
            United States.</p>
        <p>In India, <del>for</del>
            <add>of</add> each 100 first-born children 22.7 do not live <add>to
                its first holiday</add> and this is only a little higher than
            the figure for our country. The second and third children have about
            the same chance of survival--21.4 of them do not live to complete
            their first year. The infant mortality rate increases rapidly with
            the fourth, fifth, and sixth children because they have much less
            care. Of those who are born tenth in the family 42 out of each 100
            die in infancy; and the rate rises to 51 and 60 for the 11th and
            12th children.</p>
        <p>Figures from the <org>United States Children's Bureau</org> show that
            the life of a baby in America is also largely dependent upon where
            the child is placed in the family. As for child spacing, unless the
            children are properly spaced the health of the mother is greatly
            depleted and the child is not born with a sound and healthy body. If
            during the pre-natal life it is not adequately nourished, i.e.
            unless the father's wage is such to provide the family with
            sufficient food, the child, of course, does not have a chance to
            develop and grow through early infancy.</p>
        <p><del>If</del>
            <add>The density of population</add> all of India <del>there are
                only</del>
            <add>is about</add> 195 people per square mile, but in some villages
            we find that there are 2000 and even 4000 people living per square
            mile. These people simply eke out an existence--they are the poor
                <del>farmer</del> class with barely enough to eat, since they
            have not learned to use properly what little land they have. They
            know little or nothing of the [] <add>Scientific</add> methods of
            farming such as irrigation, rotation of crops, and the proper
                <del>nourishment has gone out of the soil and land produces less
                and less each year.</del> fertilization of the soil.
                <add>Nourishment has gone out of the soil, and the land produces
                less and less each year.</add> It is said that ninety-five per
            cent of them do not have what we would consider a “full meal” a day,
            and that ninety-seven per cent live on less than five cents in
            American money per day. The figures given out by the British
            officials do not agree with these figures. They claim that only
            twenty per cent of the people are very, very poor. Of course, as in
            all countries, a few people, the minority, live in luxury and beauty
            and have some of the loveliest things of the world. It is difficult
            to find out the actual facts<add>, just as</add> it is difficult to
            find out even in America actually what ninety-five per cent of our
            people earn and what percentage go hungry.</p>
        <p>In the large cities in India, we find people sleeping out of doors in
            the streets--people who have no homes or shelter to go to and who
            beg in the markets by day. I would far rather sleep out of doors in
            India where the nights are warm, with the wide blue heavens above me
            and the thousands of twinkling stars to make my roof, than to sleep
            in a crowded tenement on the <place>Lower East Side</place> of
                <place reg="New York City, NY">New York City</place>, where
            there are eight and ten and even twelve persons packed into a three
            or two-room tenement with its foul and fetid air, its disease, and
            its lack of even the most necessary sanitation!
                <emph>(Applause)</emph></p>
        <p>Welfare work in India has been largely concerned with obtaining the
            proper hospital facilities for women, and where formerly very few of
            the women had their children in hospitals with proper medical care,
            sixty-five per cent of the babies born in Bombay are now delivered
            in hospitals. In India, a new day is dawning. They are saving more
            babies each year by giving them the proper care in baby
            clinics--physical examinations, co liver oil, and the correct diet.
                <del>They are</del>
            <add>The State is</add> willing to assume the cost and make
            provisions for such care, but as I pointed out to the officials and
            social workers in one community <add>and []</add> where they are
            making rapid strides in infant care, what are the provisions to be
            for taking care of these children when they reach the ages of two
            and three? Unless they know now that the families will <add>continue
                to give</add>
            <del>assume</del> the same care <del>of</del><add>to</add> these
            babies when they become of walking age, the mortality rates for that
            age group will rise sharply within the next five years. They must
            either plan their budgets to take care of the children until they
            are able to take care of themselves, <add>or</add> supplement the
            family income, or give the mothers knowledge of how to space and
            control births.</p>
        <p>These facts had not previously been considered, but immediately these
            officials and workers asked how it could be done. They did not stop
            to parley about the cost or the work. They simply asked, “How?” And
            the answer is: by allowing the mother to space her children properly
            so that she can care for each one until it has a fair start in life.
            Mothers should know how to plan each pregnancy, Naturally the small
            child of two or three will receive more attention if there is not a
            tinier brother or sister, and perhaps another baby about to be born.
            The mother cannot possibly carry on with her strength constantly
            depleted by too numerous pregnancies, so that her boy never has a
            chance to recuperate and build itself up. And, what is worse, she
            has very little chance, of surviving such rapid demands on her
            body.</p>
        <p>But these people asked: When can we begin? And I am happy to say that
            when I left India there were fifty contraceptive centers already
            established under the proper authorities either in hospitals, in
            public health clinics where the necessary information as to the
            methods is given by a doctor or nurse under the doctors’ supervision
            to these mothers. There was no question, is this moral, is it
            ethical, is it proper. It was, they understood, necessary, and that
            was all. They were delighted to accept the idea of a birth
            control.</p>
        <p>We held over forty-three medical meetings, and the attitude of the
            doctors was splendid. I had with me two scientific films on
                “<title>The Biology of Conception</title>,” and these helped in
            explaining the technical aspects of contraception to the physicians.
            Not only were the doctors willing to have these films presented to
            their own groups, but they invited senior medical students and
            trained nurses to attend. Here again I was impressed by the
            difference in attitude--in India when the doctors found something of
            interest and worth while, they were only too willing to share it and
            to have it used.</p>
        <p>And now I want to tell you a little about my visit with Mahatma
            Gandhi, at Wardha. As soon as I arrived at Bombay, there was a
            message to the effect that Gandhi would receive me, that I should
            come at any time and stay as long as I wished. And, of course, I
            wanted to pay my respects to him, admiring and venerating him
            greatly and knowing that he is best loved of all in India. I had
            only three days to spend at Wardha, not a very long time for what we
            had to consider, because when the Mahatma was asked if he were going
            to be converted by Margaret Sanger, he replied that he was going to
            convert her. However, I arrived at Wardha on Monday, to find that
            this was Gandhi's day of silence, so I could not talk with him.
            However, I did have the opportunity of talking with some of the
                <del>[]</del>
            <add>members</add> in his household. They all arose at four o’clock
            in the morning, and from five to six gathered for prayers. On the
            second day of my visit, <add>starting</add> at seven o’clock
            promptly, the Mahatma and I walked for an hour. This was very
            delightful, even though there was no “shop talk” while we were
            walking to the village and back. We had breakfast at eleven and
            supper at five, and in the intervals we conferred. He ate sparingly,
            but the rest of us had more than we could eat and in abundance. Of
            course, he had his secretary and I had mine, and they took down
            every one of our “golden words.” Gandhi agreed with me in principle,
            and I agreed with him in principle. He said he was a greater
            feminist than I was, because he believed women should have
            everything to say about babies. I said I thought it should be
            fifty-fifty: that the women should say “when” and the man should say
            “how many,” as he has to support them. Gandhi said he was informed,
            that he knew what women had to go through <del>(and that he was
                thinking entirely in his own province.)</del> He said he did not
            believe that India has a particular problem in population. He felt
            that if India ever developed and fulfilled her own destiny, she
            could solve her own population problem. Of course, we disagreed on
            that.</p>
        <p>We discussed marriage, remarriage, and divorce. We discussed
            population from every aspect; we discussed continence, the safe
            period or rhythm, and birth control. <add>He</add> told
                <del>him</del>
            <add>me</add> that even though continence <del>might</del>
            <add>would</add> be better <add>for the peoples</add> spiritually
                <add>development</add> I <add>replied</add> that until people
            come to that point, <add>and accepted continence in practice</add>
            it would be far better to use the safest methods <add>of BC</add>
            and bring <add>a solution to their national and family
            problem</add>. Incidentally, Dr. Tagore encouraged me greatly by
            agreeing on this particular question.</p>
        <p>I had just one more story to tell you before I finish. I was the
            guest for a short time at the home of a very cultured family who had
            three girls, but no sons. My coming had been discussed and the
            youngest child, who was very precocious, had thought over what she
            had heard. Finally she came to her father and said: “<q who="UNK"
                >Daddy, if you had met Margaret Sanger before I was born, would
                I be here?</q>” And her Daddy took her up in his arms and gave
            her the answer which I am sure you will all feel every parent should
            be able to give his children. He said, “<q who="UNK">Joan, dear, if
                there were a <emph>hundred</emph> Margaret Sangers you would
                still be here, because <emph>we wanted you</emph>!!</q>”</p>
