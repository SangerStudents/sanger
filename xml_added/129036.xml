        <head>MY WAY TO PEACE</head>
        <byline><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p> Science has been applied to the various channels of life’s needs especially our
            environment. Industry, commerce, education, hygiene, surgery, agriculture, dairy,
            factory, mining and even war have had the benefits of the best that science could
            command; but it has not yet been applied to improving the quality of life itself nor to
            the maintenance of PEACE.</p>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">MY WAY TO PEACE would be </head>
            <p>First, to put into action the fourteen points of President <person
                    reg="Wilson, Woodrow">Wilson’s</person>, upon which <place>Germany</place> and
                    <place>Austria</place> surrendered to the Allies. Second, have <org
                    reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> set up a special department for the study of
                population problems; and appoint a Parliament of Population Directors representing
                the various branches of science.</p>
            <p>This body to direct and control the population through birth rates and immigration,
                and to direct its distribution over the country according to national needs
                consistent with taste, fitness and interest of the individuals.</p>
            <p>The main objects of the Population Congress would be: <lb/>(a) to raise the level and
                increase the general intelligence of population. <lb/>(b) to increase the population
                slowly by keeping the birth rate at its present level of fifteen, <emph
                    rend="underline">decreasing</emph> the death rate below its present mark of 11.
                <lb/>(c) keep the doors of Immigration closed to the entrance of certain aliens
                whose condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race, such as
                feeble-minded, idiots, morons, insane, syphilitic, epileptic, criminal, professional
                prostitutes, and others in this class barred by the immigration laws of 1924.
                <lb/>(d) apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization, and segregation to that
                grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such
                that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring. <lb/>(e) to insure the
                country against future burdens of maintenance for numerous offspring as may be born
                feeble-minded parents, the government would pension all persons with transmissible
                disease who voluntarily consent to sterilization. <lb/>(f) the whole dysgenic
                population would have its choice of segregation or sterilization. <lb/>(g) there
                would be farm lands and homesteads where these segregated persons would be taught to
                work under competent instructors for the period of their entire lives.</p>
            <p>The first step would thus be to control the intake and output on morons, mental
                defectives, epileptics.</p>
            <p>The second step would be to take an inventory of the secondary group such as
                illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes, dope-fiends; classify
                them in special departments under government medical protection, and segregate them
                on farms and open spaces as long as necessary for the strengthening and development
                of moral conduct.</p>
            <p>Having corralled this enormous part of our population and placed it on a basis of
                health not punishment, it is safe to say that fifteen or twenty millions of our
                population would then be organized into soldiers of defense--defending the unborn
                against their own disabilities.</p>
            <p>The third step would be to give special attention to the mothers’ health, to see that
                women who are suffering from tuberculosis, heart or kidney disease, toxic goitre,
                gonorrhea, or any disease where the condition of pregnancy disturbs her health;
                place these mothers under public health nurses to instruct them in practical
                scientific methods of contraception in order to safeguard their lives-- thus
                reducing maternal mortality.</p>
            <p>There would be a careful follow-up in the homes where infants have died, to ascertain
                the causes and to prevent when possible the further increase of children until the
                causes have been removed--reducing infant mortality.</p>
            <p>While the above steps seem to be emphasis on a health program instead of on tariffs,
                moratoriums and debts, I believe that national health is the first essential factor
                in any program for universal peace.</p>
            <p>With the future citizen safeguarded from hereditary taints, with five million mental
                and moral degenerates segregated, with ten million women and ten million children
                receiving adequate attention, we could then turn our attention to the basic needs
                for international peace.</p>
            <p>There would then be a definite inexorable ruling that the population should increase
                slowly and at a specific rate, in order to accommodate and adjust increasing numbers
                to our social and economic system.</p>
            <p>The Birth Rate in the <place reg="United States">United States</place> in
                1931 was 15.0 and the death rate about 11, which allowed for a survival rate of 4%,
                or an increase in the population, including immigration, of over 20%.</p>
            <p>Immigration:</p>
            <p>Open the gates of the U.S.A. to those countries whose inhabitants have the inherent
                talents and national characteristics desirable, eliminating entirely those countries
                whose subjects have already been difficult to assimilate.</p>
            <p>This plan to be in operation for ten years.</p>
            <p>In the meantime we shall organize and join an International League of Low Birth Rate
                Nations to secure and maintain WORLD PEACE.</p>
