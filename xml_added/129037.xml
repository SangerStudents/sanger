        <head>MY WAY TO PEACE</head>
        <byline><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p> Science has been applied to the various channels of life’s needs especially to our
            environment. Industry, commerce, education, hygiene, surgery, agriculture, dairy,
            factory, mining and even war have had the benefits of the best that science could
            command; but it has not yet been applied to improving the quality of life itself nor to
            the maintenance of PEACE.</p>
        <p>MY WAY TO PEACE would be First, to put into action the fourteen points of President
                <person reg="Wilson, Woodrow">Wilson</person>’s, upon which <place>Germany</place>
            and <place>Austria</place> surrendered to <org reg="Allied Powers">the Allies</org>.
            Second, to have <org rend="United States Congress">Congress</org> set up a special
            department for the study of population problems, and appoint a Parliament of Population
            Directors representing the various branches of science.</p>
        <p>This body to direct and control the population through Birth rates and immigration, and
            direct its distribution over the country according to national needs consistent with the
            taste, fitness and interest of the individuals.</p>
        <p>The main objects of the Population Congress would be:</p>
        <p>(a) to raise the level and increase the general intelligence of our population.</p>
        <p>(b) to increase the population slowly by keeping the birth rate at its present level of
            fifteen, <emph rend="underline">decreasing</emph> the death rate below its present mark
            of 11.</p>
        <p>(c) keep the doors of Immigration closed to the entrance of certain aliens whose
            condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race, such as feeble-minded,
            idiots, morons, insane, syphiletic, epileptic, criminal, professional prostitutes, and
            others in this class barred from entrance by the <name type="law"
                reg="Immigration act of 1924 (Johnson-Reed Act)">Immigration Laws of
            1924</name>.</p>
        <p>(d) apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization, and segregation to that grade of
            population whose progeny is already tainted or whose inheritance is such that
            objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.</p>
        <p>(e) to insure the country against future burdens of maintenance for numerous offspring as
            may be born of feeble-minded parents, the government would pension all persons with
            transmissible disease who voluntarily consent to sterilization.</p>
        <p>(f) the whole dysgenic population would have its choice of segregation or
            sterilization.</p>
        <p>(g) there would be farm lands and homesteads where these segregated persons would be
            taught to work under competent instructors for the period of their entire lives.</p>
        <p>The first step would thus be to control the intake and output on morons, mental
            defectives, epileptics.</p>
        <p>The second step would be to take an inventory of the secondary group such as illiterates,
            paupers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes, dope-fiends; classify them in special
            departments under government medical protection and segregate on farms and open spaces
            as long as necessary for the strengthening and development of moral conduct.</p>
        <p>Having coralled this enormous part of our population and placed it on a basis of health
            not punishment, it is safe to say that about fifteen or twenty millions of our
            population would then be organized into soldiers of defense–-defending the unborn
            against their own disabilities.</p>
        <p> The third step would be to give special attention to the mothers’ health, to see that
            women who are suffering from tuberculosis, heart or kidney disease, toxis goitre,
            gonorrhea, or any disease where the condition of pregnancy disturbs her health; place
            these mothers under public health nurses to instruct them in practical scientific
            methods of contraception in order to safeguard their lives–thus reducing maternal
            mortality.</p>
        <p>There would be a careful follow-up in the homes where infants have died, to ascertain the
            causes and to prevent when possible the further increase of children until the causes
            have been removed–-reducing infant mortality.</p>
        <p>While the above steps seem to be emphasis on a health program instead of on tariffs,
            moratoriums and debts, I believe that national health is the first essential factor in
            any program for universal peace.</p>
        <p>With the future citizens safeguarded from hereditary taints, with five million mental and
            moral degenerates segregated, with ten million women and ten million children receiving
            adequate attention, we could then turn our attention to the basic needs for
            international peace.</p>
        <p>There would then be a definite inexorable ruling that the population should increase
            slowly at a specified rate, in order to accommodate and adjust the increasing numbers to
            our social and economic system.</p>
        <p>The Birth Rate in the <place>United States</place> in 1931 was 15.0 and the death rate
            about 11, which allowed for a survival rate of 4%, or an increase in the population,
            including immigration, of over 20%.</p>
        <p> Immigration: Open the gates of the U.S.A. to those countries whose inhabitants have the
            inherent talents and national characteristics desirable, eliminating entirely those
            countries whose subjects have already been difficult to assimilate.</p>
        <p>This plan to be in operation for ten years. In the meantime we shall organize and join an
            International League of Low Birth Rate Nations to secure and maintain WORLD PEACE.</p>
