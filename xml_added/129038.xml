        <head>National Health Training Service for Girls</head>

        <p>National defense against the threat of total war requires that every factor in the
            national life be secured against breakdown. National security depends as much upon the
            health and vigor of the civilian population as upon that of men in the armed forces. The
            nation cannot afford to have any worker handicapped by preventable diseases or distress,
            either in himself or in the members of his family. It is obvious that good health stands
            high among the requirements for assuring high morals and ability to stand heavy
            strain.</p>
        <p>To integrate the defense of health, it is essential that large numbers of women and girls
            be trained and mobilized for everyday service in health protection and for special
            service in time of emergency.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in modern wars, the care of refugees creates an emergency of such titanic
            vastness that an increasing number of persons trained in medical care is a crying
            present need. <person reg="Roosevelt, Franklin Delano">President Roosevelt</person>
            recently declared that hundreds of thousands--millions perhaps--of refugees will have to
            be looked after at the end of the present conflict. This problem has been increased
            since his words were spoken, and the end is not in sight. In <place reg="United States"
                >America</place>, the refugees of the depression are already a source of national
            weakness, which cannot safely be neglected in view of what may come later.</p>
        <p>The <org>American Health Service</org> would be organized to provide to thousands of
            young girls a year’s intensive training in medical and humane services. The girls, who
            in general would be the sisters of the boys now working in the <org
                reg="Civilian Conservation Corps">CCC</org> or in the <org reg="United States Army"
                >Army</org>, would be given a preparation for playing a valuable role for the
            benefit of the nation in war or peace.</p>
        <p>In every state, young girls applying for work would be referred to the <org
                reg="National Youth Administration">NYA</org> for an opportunity to enlist in the
                <org reg="American Health Service">Health Service corps</org>. Incidentally, they
            would be in this way removed from the labor market for a year, and returned a year later
            with a training that would have greatly increased their ability to enter useful
            employment.</p>
        <p>After mental and physical examination, the girls would be registered by the NYA in public
            hospitals and welfare institutions; given attractive uniforms to assure their sense of
            important service; assigned board and lodging and $25.00 per month. $15.00 of this to go
            to parents or dependents, and $10.00 to be for personal use.</p>
        <p>The personnel of the American Health Service would be organized into units ordinarily
            transferred from one type of training to another every three months. The training would
            be in four three month terms, as follows:</p>
        <p rend="blockquote"><emph rend="underline">FIRST TERM: First three months</emph>
            Examination for physical defects and therapy indicated. . . Personal hygiene and
            cleanliness. . . Home sanitation. . . Making beds, cleaning of floors, plumbing,
            toilets, baths, etc. . . private and public sanitation and hygiene. Lectures in
            sanitation and health protection. . Nature of contagious and infectious diseases. . .
            Technique of prevention. . . Extermination of vermin. . Practical economy of cleanliness
            in all fields. . . Inculcation of ideal that there is nothing menial nor demeaning in
            any task or chore upon which national well being and defense depend. . Development of
            spirit of loyal team work and patriotic service.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote"><emph rend="underline">SECOND TERM: Second three months</emph>
            Nutrition and simple dietectics. Cleaning, preparation, cooking and serving of simple
            meal. . . Study of food and nutritional values. . . Lectures and examinations of
            chemistry of food stuffs. . . Marketing and stewardship.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote"><emph rend="underline">THIRD TERM: Third three months</emph> Essentials
            of practical pediatrics and care of maternal cases after birth. (It is not generally
            recognized that one million maternal cases in this country each year receive no
            post-natal care) The AHS units would not supplement the mid-wife or nurse in maternal
            cases, but would supplement with care, under the direction of properly constituted
            authorities. . . The AHS girls would be trained in bathing, dressing, hygiene and
            general infant care.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote"><emph rend="underline">FINAL TERM: Last three months</emph> Regular
            service in hospital wards as assistant to nurses and doctors. . Bed making, serving of
            trays to patients. On call to bells and training in general hospital service, general
            first aid instruction for accidents and emergency illness.</p>
        <p>The training would be aimed not at professional status, but at general competence in the
            performance of everyday tasks, with an ideal of human service. In the absence of local
            emergencies, the chief value of the training will be to facilitate a broad and rapid
            improvement in the health conditions of low income families to which most of the girls
            to be trained belong. There would be no professional competition with trained experts,
            since the girls in general lack the educational background to qualify as trained nurses
            or satisfactory midwives. On the other hand, in case of emergency, when trained
            personnel is required to be drawn away from ordinary civilian service, the American
            Health Service girls could be used as assistants to the remaining heavily overburdened
            staffs.</p>
        <p>Even at the present time, as is well known, many hospitals are seriously overcrowded. In
            some cases one nurse may be assigned to fifty patients, and many patients are without
            ward bells and have no way of notifying the nurse in case of emergency needs. A corps of
            partly trained assistants would be of great help in alleviating the suffering that now
            results from overloading the regular staff.</p>
        <p>The plan is presented as one of the essential “<q who="ROOFR">improvements in our own
                social and economic life</q>,” which, as the president urged in his <place
                reg="Charlottesville, VA">Charlottesville</place> address, are “<q who="ROOFR">a
                component part of national defense itself.</q>” with patriotic appeal, with
            attractive, simple and stylish uniforms, and a corresponding attitude of appreciation
            from the government and the public, the girls will develop a loyalty and pride in their
            service. Because of the intensely humane character of this training, it will not only be
            useful in the strain of war, but will remain as a net gain in the years following, when
            so many of the temporary effects of war enthusiasm inevitably collapse.</p>
        <p>Federal, State and local institutions should be encouraged to cooperate with the American
            Health Service in a manner similar to the cooperation of the schools with the NYA. The
            patriotic motive should of course be reinforced by organizing the work so as to give a
            maximum of valuable aid to the cooperating organizations in full recognition of the
            national value of their regular services. The units would be under their own directors
            but subordinate to the functions of the organizations to which they might be
            assigned.</p>
        <p>It appears obvious that the objection of expense, sure to be raised at the first
            suggestion of a new large-scale program, will rapidly evaporate in the heat of present
            events, as the danger and the nature of total war become more apparent to the American
            people. Plans for a program of the kind suggested should therefore, proceed as rapidly
            as possible, with the assurance that the recognition of their necessity will tread close
            on the heals of the plans.</p>
        <p>This service will tend to eliminate the fears and prejudices of race color, creed, and
            sex in the service of humanity.</p>
