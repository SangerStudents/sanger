        <head>The Necessity for Birth Control</head>
        <byline>by Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p><org>Auditorium Theater</org>, <place reg="Oakland, CA">Oakland, California</place>.
                    <dateline><date value="1928-12-19">December 19th 1928</date></dateline>.</p>
        <p>It was <person reg="Hugo, Victor">Victor Hugo</person> who said <q who="HUGVI">there was
                no force in the world so great as that of an idea whose hour had come</q>. Some of
            us believe that the hour for Birth Control has come. There are very few subjects
                <add>which have so large a </add>
            <del>of so</del> practical <del>a</del> significance which <add>cut</add> so deeply into
            the foundations of social <del>welfare</del>
            <add>evolution</add> as Birth Control. There are few <add>other</add> subjects that have
            been left so long in obscurity while, at the same time, there are few that can so
            demonstrate their importance as Birth Control has done in the past few years.</p>
        <p><person reg="Shaw, George Bernard">George Bernard Shaw</person> said that <q who="SHAGE"
                >Birth Control is the most revolutionary idea of the twentieth century</q>. <person
                reg="Wells, H. G.">H. G. Wells</person> says <q who="WELHE">it is the most momentous
                fact of modern living</q>. I claim that Birth Control is <del>a</del>
            <add>the keynote of a </add> new moral responsibility, a new social awakening. It is not
            only a health and economic <del>safeguard</del>
            <add>expedient</add> but a great social <del>expedient</del>
            <add>principle</add> interlocked with the <add>spiritual</add> progress of the
                <del>human</del> race <add>and its future</add>.</p>
        <p>To define Birth Control, we say it is the conscious control of the birth-rate by
            scientific means that prevent the conception of human life. Prevent, remember. Prevent
            does not mean to interfere. It does not mean to destroy. There is no more interference
            with life through birth control than there is to remain unmarried or to live a celibate
            life. We also say “to control.” Control does not mean that you limit. When you control
            your furnace you do not have to put the fire out. When you control your motor you do not
            necessarily stop your car. To control the birth rate means that there shall be the same
            right for those who do not wish to have children as for those who do wish to have them.
            There are no objections to those who wish to increase the size of their families, but on
            the other side there seems to be a great deal of question and controversy as to the
            right of those who wish to limit or control the number of their children. Why, they say,
            should there be any necessity to control or limit population in this great land and
            especially out here in the west where there are so many large <del>spaces</del>
            <add>acres</add>of unused territory.</p>
        <p>Civilization is confronted with two problems-- pressure of population on the food supply
                <add>of the world</add> and the reconciling of humanitarian efforts with <del>the
                greatest improvement of the</del> race <add>improvement</add>. I believe birth
            control is the key to both. Statistics tell us that from fifteen to twenty millions of
            persons are born in this <del>country</del>
            <add>world</add> every year. That means fifty thousand a day. Certainly we
                <del>must</del> believe that something <del>must</del>
            <add>should</add> be done with this enormous <del>group</del>
            <add>increase</add> of <del>new</del> population. It must be controlled. There are only
            two ways of controlling it. INCREASING the death rate or DECREASING the birth rate.
            Which shall it be? History records the fact that population has always been kept down by
            war, by famine, by disease by floods and pestilence. Nature is most ruthless in
            extermination; she crushes to the wall the old, the sick, the demented, the diseased,
            the inefficient and through these means <del>was</del>
            <add>is</add> able to perfect her type. But civilization today will no longer permit
            those methods to operate. With the hand of charity and philanthropy, democracy and
            Christianity, we reach out and grapple with Nature. We take to ourselves these
            inefficient, demented, or feeble-minded persons and we tax the normal, the fit and the
            healthy members of the population for their care. Through these methods we are brining
            civilization to a queer pass. William <del>Sanyer</del>
            <add><person reg="Meyers, William Starr">Starr Meyer</person></add> of <org>Princeton
                University</org> tells us that out of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="MSPP"/>
            <add>one</add>
            <add>105,000,000</add> hundred and <del>twenty</del>
            <add>five</add> million people, only twenty million can be classified as intellectual.
            From <add>the 85 million thru</add> psychological, biological and other tests it is
            found that 45-million are sub-normal, with intellects equal to juveniles of fifteen
            years; fifteen million were definitely feeble-minded, with eight year old minds; while
            25-million could at best be classified as mediocre. Of course we all hope that we belong
            to the 20-million class. It is that enormous group of feeble-minded that gives concern
            to those of us who are socially minded.</p>
        <p>Many of us remember the two famous families, the <org reg="Kallikak Family"
                >Kallikaks</org> and the <org reg="Juke Family">Jukes</org>. The first started by a
            feeble-minded man marrying a normal woman. We know that two feeble-minded persons have
            never been known to bring to birth a normal child, but here we started with a normal
            woman. 470 of their descendants were normal: 143 were feeble-minded: 36 were
            illegitimate; three were epileptics: 83 died in infancy: three were criminals and
            twenty-four died in houses of ill fame.</p>
        <p>The Jukes family had 1200 descendants; of these 130 were professional paupers; 135 were
            common criminals; 70 were thieves; the expense of maintaining this family was
            $1,300,00-- and that too, was in the days when we did not have to count the high cost of
            living. Today we know for a fact that the high proportion of feeble-minded in our
            population is one of the great problems of civilization.</p>
        <p>All over the country we find that institutions are not numerous enough or large enough to
            take care of our feeble-minded population. <place>California</place> has been one of the
            few States advanced enough to take hold of this question and try to solve it through
            sterilization. Reckoning three children for each feeble-minded couple, out of six
            thousand sterilized, California has saved herself eighteen thousand feeble minded
            persons.</p>
        <p>It is not sufficient to take only the feeble-minded who are in institutions; only a small
            proportion of them are there. Millions live with us-- with no regard whatever for the
            coming race. They continue to make our problems and to bring numerous children into the
            world.</p>
        <p>Our insane question is almost as serious. In <place>New York State</place> a few years
            ago there was a great deal of pride on the part of the <person reg="Smith, Albert E."
                >Governor</person> and <org reg="New York State Assembly">Legislature</org> because
            they came before the public and said they had been able to appropriate the sum of
            twenty-five million dollars for the care of the insane. No one seemed to ask what they
            were doing to decrease the numbers of the insane. New York has, and I presume California
            also, the practice of allowing inmates of asylums suffering from certain types of
            insanity to return home periodically on what is called the parole system. A man confined
            in an asylum after <del>for</del> a certain period of time is allowed to return to his
            family on certain occasions; also a mother or woman. There is no responsibility on the
            part of the State to see that anything is done, or any knowledge given to that inmate or
            his family to see that children do not come from that individual.</p>
        <p>We have had many cases where women, having been informed that the husband is returning,
            have come to our social agencies and begged that something should be done, often stating
            they already have two or three feeble-minded children or idiots. Often the women in
            these families are the bread-winner and she has begged the organizations, who are there
            to protect motherhood, to do something about this problem. In no case, in <place
                reg="New York, NY">New York city</place>, have I know that these women were ever
            helped in a fundamental way. They have been told not to worry, have been cheered as much
            as they could be cheered, and told that when such a condition arose they could come to
            the pre-natal clinic and care given them-- and that is all. That seems to me a very
            short-sighted policy on the part of the social agencies and other groups, well-meaning,
            no doubt, but nevertheless very sentimental.</p>
        <p>Not only the feeble-minded and insane deserve consideration. There are two groups of
            people in the world-- not only in the <place>United States</place> but in almost all
            large cities of the civilized world. One group is what I term the small family group;
            the other is the large family group. When you look at the small family group you will
            see they have by far the best of it. It is there we find health, wealth, culture,
            education, intelligence. It is where there are few children, well spaced, that those few
            are brought up to full maturity. The children of this group are not sent to factories
            but to school, because of the desire of the parents to give them the best opportunities.
            They go to high school, to colleges, to universities. It is from this group that the
            best positions in the community are usually filled. It is from this group that those who
            desire to see large populations desire they should come.</p>
        <p>On the other hand is the large family group; it has a hard time. You find there poverty.
            Poverty and large families almost always go hand in hand. You find mothers bearing
            children far too frequently, without regard to her health or the father’s earning
            capacity. It is there we find slums, overcrowding, not only in homes but in the
            community. We find there, too, terrible infant and maternal mortality, ignorance,
            disease, unemployment, child labor, and all the problems we are trying today to
            solve.</p>
        <p>I know this group fairly well and I know the mothers here are not desirous of frequent
            child-bearing any more than the mothers of the other group. But seek and ask where they
            will there is no way for them to get advice or instruction on how to control the size of
            their families. All agencies are turned against them; they must turn to the interrupted
            pregnancy or bring unwanted children into the world year in and year out.</p>
        <p>We are known in America to be a very generous hearted people; we are known throughout the
            world as being very large spenders. We have in the past ten years spent NINE BILLION
            DOLLARS on what are called the four D’s-- DISEASE: DEFECTS: DELINQUENCY: DEPENDENCY. I
            have no quarrel even with that enormous amount if we could only be assured that it was
            not going to increase the next year and the following year. But we have no such
            assurance. In fact, judging by the past ten years, we have no reason to believe
            anything, except that we will be paying, not nine or ten but perhaps fifteen billion
            dollars to take care of the four D’s in the next ten years.</p>
        <p>Will all you who are interested in social work follow me for a moment to see how we
            really attack one or two of these questions.</p>
        <p>Take Maternal Mortality. It is really a disgrace that this country, which has so many
            spendid social organizations and institutions, should yet have its maternal mortality
            increased during the last few years. Twenty thousand mothers passed out from causes due
            to pregnancy during the past year. Twenty thousand mothers means two mothers for every
            hour, night and day. We know that tubercular women, or women with heart or kidney
            trouble should never be allowed to take the risk of motherhood. We know, too, that even
            tubercular women die, not from tuberculosis but from pregnancy. We know that the medical
            profession has every right, legally and morally, to interrupt that condition. Then what?
            They send her back to her home, to face the same conditions, in utter ignorance and with
            a death sentence hanging over her head.</p>
        <p>With Infant Mortality we have done better. It is today I believe down to two hundred
            thousand infants who died before reaching their first birthday. We have reduced it but
            oh, at such a cost, not only in money but a whole group of individuals have devoted the
            best part of their lives to keeping alive children who never should have been born.</p>
        <p>We do everything to keep our children alive but in most cases it is like locking the door
            after the horse is stolen. We have our Milk Stations, our Maternity Centers; we have
            Nurseries; we send nurses into the homes to tell the mothers of eight or nine children
            how to have their tenth child. What those mothers really want to know is how not to have
            that tenth or eleventh baby. Worst of all, we allow the 200,000 mothers and fathers of
            these children to remain in ignorance of how to prevent the birth of two hundred
            thousand children next year.</p>
        <p>The <org reg="United States Children's Bureau">Children’s Bureau</org> of the <org
                reg="United States Department of Labor">Labor Dept.</org> at <place
                reg="Washington, DC">Washington</place> throws a light on the infant mortality of
            this country by telling us that the father’s wage has much to do with it. As his wage
            goes down, his family goes up. They also tell us that the spacing of children in the
            family has much to do with infant death; if there is an interval of two, three or four
            years that child has a better chance to live. They tell us also that number of children
            in the family has much to do with infant mortality and that the second child has a much
            better chance to live than the tenth or twelfth. For every second child born there is
            less than 100 deaths per thousand; for the fifth child, about 350; for the twelfth it is
            600 out of every thousand Sixty per cent of twelfth children born do not live to see
            their first birthday. What useless waste of womanhood and motherhood. What an orgy of
            agony!</p>
        <p>I maintain that if we are ever going to do anything about infant mortality we have got to
            stop the unending stream of unwanted babies. We cannot sweep back the tide with the
            broom of organized charity or palliative legislation. We have to stop it at the source
            by safe and sound information to control birth.</p>
        <p>Another question concerns us. Child labor. Most of us believe there is no such thing. We
            think children are protected by the laws of this country from work. But that is not
            true. For fifty years the <org reg="United States Child Labor Commission">Child Labor
                Commission</org> has been trying to do away with Child Labor. They have not been
            successful. There are seven million children under 14 years of age who are engaged in
            gainful occupations. Have any of you seen children in the Southern mills going to work
            before the sun is up and returning after sunset? If you knew the conditions where these
            children are, you would know they are doomed to it. Fathers in many cases remain at
            home, doing much of the housework because he cannot get an adult man’s pay. Little ones
            of 6 or 7 are standing on boxes or benches because the machinery was made for their
            parents; here you find these little ones crowding so closely into the family that it is
            absolutely necessary for each of them as soon as they can to get out and compete with
            father and mother just for their daily existence. The same applies to children toiling
            in the fields, for instance, of <place>Colorado</place>. I went myself into the wheat
            fields of Colorado and it was astounding to me that we cannot have a little more
            fundamental attitude toward child labor; children of three and four were crawling on the
            ground like animals, putting fruit into baskets, their little backs permanently bent. To
            look into the faces of the parents of these twelve or fifteen children was to know that
            they were not capable of taking care of themselves, to say nothing of a large family,--
            which should never have been brought into the world. I’d like to see the <org>Society
                for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</org> begin a little further back and
            prevent the cruelty of children being born in misery and disease. I should like to see
            the time when the <org>United States Government</org> would have to guarantee a passport
            of health for every child born in this country.</p>
        <p>If we could imagine it I think the children would like to take a look at their parents
            before being born and to ask them a few questions. If parents had to apply for children
            as they do for cooks and chaffeurs, the children might ask them for their health
            certificate. They might say: “<q who="UNK">What is the idea of having me? How do you
                live? What kind of table do you set? What are your plans for bringing me up? Am I to
                spend my childhood in a factory or a playground?</q>” It might even say: “<q
                who="UNK">Ah, Mr. Father, I am a potential genius: what do you know about the
                development of a genius? What kind of society have you constructed for my gifts to
                adorn</q>?” It might ask how many children there were already and if the answer was
            eight in two rooms and on twenty dollars a week, we can fancy it would say “<q who="UNK"
                >I’ll stay where I am</q>” and interview the next applicant.</p>
        <p>The Government is concerned about the kind of people who come here from outside. Up to
            1914 <person>Uncle Sam</person> was rather negligent about the kind of folk who
            emigrated here; he was like the parents who, although they scarcely know what they will
            do if their family is increased, yet do nothing to prevent it. Not until 1914 did the
                <org reg="United States Government">U.S. Government</org> do anything much. We did
            not encourage emigration but did nothing to stop it. Not until 1924 was it necessary to
            recognize that there was a population problem and that SOMETHING must be done for the
            future of the country. So bars were put up at the entrance of the United States. Le mt
            read you what the Government thinks likely to be a menace and source of disease to her
            people, to the happiness and wellbeing of her population. Feeble-minded persons,
            epileptics, idiots, imbeciles, insane people, tubercular, those with any loathsome or
            contagious disease, paupers, professional beggars, those likely to become a public
            charge, criminals, prostitutes, or for purposes of prostitution in any form;
            illiterates, those over 16 years unable to read English or any other language-- all are
            refused admission and procedure for the enforcement of these measures is mandatory. I
            think it is good legislation. Unfortunately it is merely negative and not selective
            legislation.</p>
        <p>If it is necessary to keep such types out of the country why is it not just as important
            to stop their breeding? it seems to me a very short-sighted procedure to make laws to
            keep them out and laws that increase and multiply them within. Immigration throughout
            the world is causing a good deal of stir; the countries of <place>Europe</place> have
            looked upon America for years as the solution of their problems. There is a good deal of
            bitterness at the United States taking this attitude and concern as to what they shall
            do. Europe claims that she has sent into the United States some of her best stocks,
            equipped us with artisans, with man made ready material. She claims she has depleted her
            own stocks by so doing, also that in order to do this in the past she has now made an
            enemy <add>and a rival</add> more powerful than all Europe combined. Many of the
            countries, like <place>England</place>, are trying to solve their over-population
            problem by sending them into the Colonies; but the Colonies in turn say they cannot use
            the slum population which England wants to get rid of; they must have men of health,
            vigor and initiative-- so say <place>New Zealand</place>, <place>Australia</place> and
                <place>Canada</place>. The slum population England has sent has been sent back and
            England today has over a million unemployed. I am glad to say nevertheless that the
                <org>British Government</org> has been thinking seriously about <del>the</del> birth
            control; two years ago the <org>House of Lords</org> went on record and passed a
            resolution asked the Government to instruct mothers throughout the <org>British
                Empire</org> in methods of contraception at Infant Welfare Stations. It is an
            astounding thing that it was the <org reg="Great Britain Labour Party">Labor Party</org>
            that refused to endorse that legislation.</p>
        <p><place>Germany</place> has also attempted to attack this question. When I was in <place
                reg="Berlin, Germany">Berlin</place> I was astonished to find there was legislation
            going on, backed up by aggressive organization both labor and medical, as well as womens
            organizations, trying to terminate pregnancy, up to the third month. They have already
            endorsed sterilization. Women interrupted pregnancy and then remained to be sterilized.
            Out of 80 women who came, 75 remained, asking to be sterilized. These women had already
            had two or more children. In almost all cases something was wrong with their health of
            the mother, heart, kidneys or other troubles. Sterilization on a large scale is taking
            place in Germany. I consider that rather harsh and there may be some regret later on but
            nevertheless Germany is face to face with the problem of the future and she feels that
            is the only emergency she can at present attack.</p>
        <p><place>Italy</place> is making a great deal of increasing population. <person
                reg="Mussolini, Benito">Mussolini</person> has said: <q who="MUSBE">No babies, no
                votes</q>. I do no know that the women particularly mind that; they might retort: No
            votes, no babies. I think Mussolini needs babies more than the women need votes. Italy
            is over-crowded. Everyone in Europe knows that. Italy cannot take care of her own
            population. Just two years ago six hundred thousand Italians and sixty thousand Poles
            went into <place>France</place>-- and France herself has begun to consider population
            and immigration, as we have the last ten years. Anyone can go into France regardless of
            their condition. Not even today does France bar out of her country even persons with a
            transmissible disease. I think only one is not admitted-- traucoma.</p>
        <p><place>Japan</place> has seven or eight hundred thousand new souls born every year.
            Crowded into a territory the size of California is a population equal to half of our
            population. All countries, except <place>South America</place>, have put up the bars
            against the Japanese. South America alone has the open door for Japan’s surplus
            population. Japan, to me, is like the chick inside the shell. Something has got to
            happen. As we all know, expansive populations of the world have caused wars over and
            over again. The economists of Europe are convinced that the peace of the world can never
            be solved until each country takes up the question of population. Until this is solved
            intelligently they may as well throw their peace treaties in the waste basket. This
            question of birth control is not only an individual, a national, and a racial problem
            but international. Many people believe that we who advocate birth control do not believe
            in having any children at all. It is not necessary to deny that to this audience; you
                <emph rend="underline">know</emph> it is not true. Nevertheless, there are
            conditions in which it would be better for children not to be born at all. I maintain
            there are seven conditions underwhich children should never be born.</p>
        <p>First: Not of parents with a transmissible disease; with insanity, feeble-mindedness,
            syphilis or epilepsy.</p>
        <p>Second: Not of mothers with heart or kidney disease, until such disease is cured.</p>
        <p>Third: Not of parents who already have a sub-normal child.</p>
        <p>Fourth: I claim there should be an interval of two to three years between children. The
            mother should have an opportunity to recover from the ordeal of one birth, to enjoy her
            new baby and a period of time to prepare herself mentally and physically for the coming
            of the next child.</p>
        <p>Fifth: No woman should have children until she has finished her adolescent period, from
            14 to 23 years. While we all know many fine children born of young mothers I maintain
            that is no longer necessary. There should be an ideal time for parenthood and that
            should be at the close of the adolescent period, when the physical, nervous and mental
            organism is developed but not yet interlocked.</p>
        <p>Sixth: There should not be more children than can be brought up decently and properly
            provided for. We have people for ten years who have been dependent upon social agencies,
            not only for the maintenance of themselves and the children they had years ago but for
            an increasing number ever since. I maintain that this is immoral in every sense of the
            word-- to have children they cannot take care of and to make their neighbors and others
            bear the consequences of their acts.</p>
        <p><emph rend="underline">Seventh:</emph> I maintain children should not be born until the
            young couple have have, say, two years of married life. I would like to see young people
            take two or three years to play together, to build up and develop their common interests
            before parenthood. I believe it is harder today for two young people to become adjusted
            to each other than it ever was in the past. We imagine they are going to live happy ever
            after, but we know their problems have just begun. It is not, after all, an easy thing
            for love to grow into the fine thing which it can be. It is not easy to strengthen the
            bond of love and to submit to that bond of marriage, unless there is time for mutual
            adjustment. If couples had two years alone together I maintain there would be more happy
            homes, fewer divorces and the possibility of the girl developing her womanhood before
            taking the responsibility of motherhood. We really see very little of the love-life of
            individuals. They are married-- and the next year become parents. The girl goes away on
            her honeymoon and comes back pregnant, physically and mentally disturbed. The husband
            has never an opportunity to know her as a woman; he knows her as a girl and then as a
            mother. I believe it would make for more happy marriages and more permanent ones if the
            fear of pregnancy could be removed or delayed, and parenthood invited instead of being
            an unwelcome accident.</p>
        <p>There are three groups of methods of preventing conception. The first is continence. The
            only organized religious body that opposes Birth Control does not condemn continence,
            but regards it as the only permissible method of birth control. The second is
            sterilization. The third, mechanical means of preventing conception. In our studies of
            the past five years we have found that continence cannot be a means of general
            application. Self-control, or continence, is a matter of one’s evolution. Sterilization
            is bound to play an important part, especially where there are transmissible diseases.
            This remedy is largely in the hands of the medical profession.</p>
        <p>It is about four years since we had the first birth control clinic in this country. To
            date, more than ten thousand women, whose histories we have on record, have come to us.
            Today we can say we know something about birth control. Ten years ago we could not say
            that. We could only say it had been practiced in <place reg="Netherlands"
                >Holland</place> and amongst the well-to-do in almost every country, but we had no
            positive information. We can today say that birth control clinics are doing a splendid
            thing, not only in giving children a better chance of life but in protecting mothers and
            reducing the enormous number of abortions. In our records we have 85 percent of the
            families going upward in the social scale. We know if we can get a woman before she has
            her fourth child there is every possibility of the husband bettering himself and the
            children going up the scale, instead of applying for work certificates before the age of
            fourteen. We know today, on a small scale (for, after all, ten thousand is a small
            scale) what birth control can do. There are twenty-five clinics in the United States,
            two in Germany, twenty in England. As to California, there are two in <place
                reg="Los Angeles, CA">Los Angeles</place>, one in <place reg="Pasadena, CA"
                >Pasadena</place>.</p>
        <p>In the past thirteen years I have received over a million letters, written mostly by
            women, sometimes on scraps of wrapping paper. They have found my name somewhere and
            written to beg for information and help. I have recently taken a cross section of these
            letters and put them in a book called “<title type="book">Motherhood in
            Bondage</title>.” If, after reading those letters, you still do not believe in birth
            control, I think such a person would be hopeless of reason. These are mothers who are
            asking for means to control the size of their families. And what, after all, are they
            asking for? For the right to live. For the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
            happiness. For the right to know their children and to bring them up decently. For the
            right also to understand their husbands and to help him, too. These letters tell strange
            and dramatic stories of life in America, a side of life that is full of suffering and
            difficulty and that does not reach the public. And have not we paid a tremendous price
            for their ignorance? Have not these poor mothers paid a price that is staggering? Yet
            where is the information they need? We are paying for their ignorance in child labor, in
            infant and maternal mortality, in feeble-mindedness and with the large numbers of the
            unfit. I think it is time for us to wake up, to make it a right and easy thing for these
            mothers to obtain information and help of the right kind. We want women to have a chance
            to develop their own personalities, to rest from incessant child-bearing, to live with
            the fear of pregnancy removed from marriage. We want children to be born of love and
            conscious desire and given a heritage of sound bodies and sane minds. We want them to
            have and to have ourselves bodies that are beautiful, holy, fit instruments for progress
            towards perfection, temples in which the soul may take its place in the mystery of
            material being.</p>
