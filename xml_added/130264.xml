		<head>Is Sex Discussion Obscene?</head>
		<byline>By Margaret H. Sanger</byline>
		<p>It is no more indecent to speak of sexual anatomy, physiology or hygiene in a sincerely
			scientific spirit than to discuss other bodily functions, as those of the stomach, heart
			or kidneys. Science does not recognize any part of the human body as obscene when
			studied with the serious purpose of ascertaining natural truths in order to promote
			health and safeguard life.</p>
