		<p>"The hundreds of thousands of abortions being performed in <place reg="United States"
				>America</place> each year are a disgrace to civilization. I lay the blame for them
			and for the illness, suffering and death resulting from them at the door of a government
			which in its puritanical blindness insists upon suffering and death from ignorance
			rather than life and happiness through knowledge and prevention."</p>
