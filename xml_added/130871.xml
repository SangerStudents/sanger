        <head>NEWS LETTER FROM MRS. SANGER.</head>
        <p>My recent experiences, while on a speaking tour, have shown me the
            extent to which the Roman <org>Catholic Church</org> dictates the
            policy of the municipal authorities in many of our cities. I was
            scheduled to speak in <place reg="Albany, NY">Albany</place>, March
            6th, at the <org>Jewish Community Center</org>. A week before the
            lecture, several Catholic officials tried to bring pressure to bear
            thru non-Catholic agencies to get the Jewish Community Center to
            rescind their invitation. Fortunately, the Auditorium belonged to
            the Jewish Group and <personRef reg="Thatcher, John Boyd">the
                Mayor</personRef> was unable to revoke the license.</p>
        <p>The same forces tried to break up the meeting at <place
                reg="New Haven, CT">New Haven</place>. The issue there was
            between the <org>Young Men's Hebrew Association</org> and a
                <personRef>Catholic priest</personRef> from <place reg="NE"
                >Nebraska</place> who was conducting a Mission. The Catholics
            succeeded in getting the license for the High School revoked at noon
            Saturday. Thanks to Dr. <person reg="Creadick, A. N.">A. N.
                Creadick</person>, President of the <org>Connecticut Birth
                Control League</org>, Dr. <person reg="Winternitz, Mathilde"
                >Winternitz</person> of the <org>Yale University School of
                Medicine</org>, members of the <org>Liberal Club</org> group,
            the <org>Junior League</org>, and others, who formed a large
            delegation which met in the <personRef reg="Murphy, John W."
                >Mayor</personRef>'s office early Monday morning to demand a
            permit for the meeting, this was finally granted for the Fox Theatre
            on Tuesday night. In view of the widespread indignation, the
            opposition did not dare push the matter further. According to
            newspaper reports, approximately 1800 people were present at the
            meeting.</p>
        <p>The permit permitting me to speak at the junior high school was
            revoked on the ground that Birth Control was not a suitable subject
            to discuss in a high school. Nevertheless, the following week the
            Rev. <person reg="Doran, Martin F.">Martin F. Doran</person>,
            chaplain of the <org>Holy Name Society</org>, spoke against birth
            control in the Fairhaven High School, at a meeting attended by 300
            people. One can see that in the State of <place reg="CT"
                >Connecticut</place>, it is legal and moral to speak <emph
                rend="underline">against</emph> a subject, but it seems unlawful
            to speak for the same subject; in other words, freedom of speech
            depends upon which side you are on.</p>
        <p>In <place reg="Boston, MA">Boston</place> I addressed a group of <org
                reg="Havard University">Harvard</org> Medical Students, under
            the auspices of the <org>Lancet Club</org>. The majority of those
            present were third year students; several had graduated and were
            doing interneship, but my address was the first information on
            contraception that they had received.</p>
        <p>On my <place reg="WV">West Virginia</place> trip, it was again a
            story of Catholic interference. The result was that the <org>Cabell
                County Medical Society</org> of <place reg="Huntington, WV"
                >Huntington</place> rescinded their invitation. However, thanks
            to the courage and fine spirit of Dr. <person reg="Klumpp, James S."
                >James S. Klumpp</person>, Dr. <person reg="Strange, William"
                >William Strange</person> and others, I was asked to speak under
            the auspices of an independent group of twenty physicians, and the
            meeting was held at the Pritchard Hotel, and was open to the public.
            Fully 1000 people attended and approximately 400 were turned away. I
            have great hopes that the interest aroused may shortly result in the
            establishment of a clinic.</p>
        <p>I also spoke at several mining camps near <place reg="Charleston, WV"
                >Charleston. W. Va.</place>, and found there conditions that
            would horrify us were we living in a <gap extent="one or two words"
            />. The women were most interested and very intelligent. The men
            more silent and opinion seemed somewhat divided among them. As a
            result of those meetings, however, another meeting was arranged the
            following week by the Catholic group to offset no doubt the
            favorable reaction toward birth control that a proper presentation
            of the subject arouses.</p>
        <p>There are plans under way to equip a birth control caravan for the
            mountains camps of West Virginia. This would make it possible for
            mothers living in remote places to have proper advice. The idea was
            greeted with enthusiasm and gratitude by the miners' wives.</p>
