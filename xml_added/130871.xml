        <head>NEWS LETTER FROM <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MRS. SANGER</person>.</head>
        <p>My recent experiences, while on a speaking tour, have shown me the extent to which the
            Roman <org reg="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</org> dictates the policy of the
            municipal authorities in many of our cities. I was scheduled to speak in <place
                reg="Albany, NY">Albany</place>, March 6th, at the <org
                reg="Albany Jewish Community Center">Jewish Community Center</org>. A week before
            the lecture, several Catholic officials tried to bring pressure to bear thru
            non-Catholic agencies to get the Jewish Community Center to rescind their invitation.
            Fortunately, the Auditorium belonged to the Jewish Group and <personRef
                reg="Thatcher, John Boyd">the Mayor</personRef> was unable to revoke the
            license.</p>
        <p>The same forces tried to break up the meeting at <place reg="New Haven, CT">New
                Haven</place>. The issue there was between the <org>Young Men’s Hebrew
                Association</org> and a <person reg="Unknown">Catholic priest</person> from <place
                reg="NE">Nebraska</place> who was conducting a Mission. The Catholics succeeded in
            getting the license for the High School revoked at noon Saturday. Thanks to Dr. <person
                reg="Creadick, A. N.">A. N. Creadick</person>, President of the <org>Connecticut
                Birth Control League</org>, Dr. <person reg="Winternitz, Mathilde"
                >Winternitz</person> of the <org>Yale University School of Medicine</org>, members
            of the <org>Liberal Club</org> group, the <org>Junior League</org>, and others, who
            formed a large delegation which met in the <person reg="Murphy, John W."
            >Mayor</person>’s office early Monday morning to demand a permit for the meeting, this
            was finally granted for the <org>Fox Theatre</org> on Tuesday night. In view of the
            widespread indignation, the opposition did not dare push the matter further. According
            to newspaper reports, approximately 1800 people were present at the meeting.</p>
        <p>The permit permitting me to speak at the junior high school was revoked on the ground
            that Birth Control was not a suitable subject to discuss in a high school. Nevertheless,
            the following week the Rev. <person reg="Doran, Martin F.">Martin F. Doran</person>,
            chaplain of the <org>Holy Name Society</org>, spoke against birth control in the
                <org>Fairhaven High School</org>, at a meeting attended by 300 people. One can see
            that in the State of <place reg="CT">Connecticut</place>, it is legal and moral to speak
                <emph rend="underline">against</emph> a subject, but it seems unlawful to speak for
            the same subject; in other words, freedom of speech depends upon which side you are
            on.</p>
        <p>In <place reg="Boston, MA">Boston</place> I addressed a group of <org
                reg="Havard University School of Medicine">Harvard</org> Medical Students, under the
            auspices of the <org>Lancet Club</org>. The majority of those present were third year
            students; several had graduated and were doing interneship, but my address was the first
            information on contraception that they had received.</p>
        <p>On my <place reg="WV">West Virginia</place> trip, it was again a story of Catholic
            interference. The result was that the <org>Cabell County Medical Society</org> of <place
                reg="Huntington, WV">Huntington</place> rescinded their invitation. However, thanks
            to the courage and fine spirit of Dr. <person reg="Klumpp, James S.">James S.
                Klumpp</person>, Dr. <person reg="Strange, William">William Strange</person> and
            others, I was asked to speak under the auspices of an independent group of twenty
            physicians, and the meeting was held at the <org>Pritchard Hotel</org>, and was open to
            the public. Fully 1000 people attended and approximately 400 were turned away. I have
            great hopes that the interest aroused may shortly result in the establishment of a
            clinic.</p>
        <p>I also spoke at several mining camps near <place reg="Charleston, WV">Charleston. W.
                Va.</place>, and found there conditions that would horrify us were we living in a
                <gap extent="one or two words"/>. The women were most interested and very
            intelligent. The men more silent and opinion seemed somewhat divided among them. As a
            result of those meetings, however, another meeting was arranged the following week by
            the Catholic group to offset no doubt the favorable reaction toward birth control that a
            proper presentation of the subject arouses.</p>
        <p>There are plans under way to equip a birth control caravan for the mountains camps of
            West Virginia. This would make it possible for mothers living in remote places to have
            proper advice. The idea was greeted with enthusiasm and gratitude by the miners’
            wives.</p>
