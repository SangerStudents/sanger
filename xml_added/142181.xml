        <head>BIRTH CONTROL IN INDIA</head>
        <byline><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET SANGER</person></byline>
        <p>President of the <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
            Control</org></p>
        <p><place reg="Washington, D.C., United States">Washington, D.C.</place></p>
        <p>The American Eugenics Society has asked me to speak to you today on my
            experiences in <place>India</place>. I was invited to come to India to address the
                <org>All India Women's Conference</org>, and it was my hope that by appearing before
            this group, which represents ten million women, and by securing the passage of a
            resolution in support of birth control, I might give impetus to the birth control
            movement in that country. I was in India a scant ten weeks, but the ground covered and
            the results obtained exceeded my wildest dreams.</p>
        <p>I arrived in <place reg="Bombay, India">Bombay</place> in early December, a month before
            the All India Women's Conference, and was immediately caught up in a whirl of meetings
            and lectures. Interest in birth control in India is tremendous, and it was a new
            experience to speak in a country without legal restrictions and with practically no
            religious opposition.</p>
        <p>A few figures as to the need of birth control in India and some summary of what has
            already been done, will interest you. Population is one of India's greatest problems.
            The census of India taken in 1931 showed a population increase of 34 millions in ten
            years. <person reg="Russell, Colonel Alexander H.J.">Colonel Russell</person>, the
            Commissioner for Public Health in India, in his last report, 1933, states that since
            1931 there has been an increase of nearly 20 millions, and that the population is now
            not less than 370 million. He estimates that by 1941, when the next census is taken, the
            population will considerably exceed 400 million, and says: “<q who="RUSAL">The problem
                of numbers is a question which will shortly force itself upon the attention of every
                man and woman in this country. It is to be hoped that it will received adequate
                notice before disaster befalls</q>.”</p>
        <p>The infant mortality and child mortality rates in India are tragically high. Each year
            1,750,000 infants die in their first year, and 50 per cent of the children die before
            reaching the age of five. It is estimated that maternal mortality accounts for 200,000
            deaths a year.</p>
        <p>In any summary of birth control work in India, mention must first be made of the
            activities of Dr. <person reg="Pillay, A.P.">A. P. Pillay</person> of Bombay. Dr.
            Pillay, as you doubtless know, founded the <title>Journal of Marriage Hygiene</title>,
            and organized the <org>Society for the Study and Promotion of Family Hygiene</org>. The
            Journal is considered the foremost international publication on the subject at present,
            and is building up a fine circulation. Despite this, some issues have encountered
            difficulty in passing the customs and in entering the United States. Dr. Pillay's center
            in Bombay is the outstanding place in India where information on birth control may be
            obtained.</p>
        <p>In <place reg="Madras, India">Madras</place>, the <org reg="Madras Neo-Malthusian League"
                >Neo-Malthusian League</org>, founded by <person reg="Ramesan, Sir Vepa">Sir Vepa
                Ramesam</person> in 1928, carried on educational birth control work. This League has
            on its Board many distinguished people, including two Maharajas, a high court judge, an
            editor, the principal of the <org>National Academy</org> in <place
                reg="Triplicane, India">Triplicane</place>, and several prominent attorneys. The
            League issues a sixteen-page magazine and will doubtless form the nucleus of a large
            network of centers covering the South of India. At <place reg="Calicut, India"
                >Calicut</place>, on the south-west coast, a <org>Birth Control Information
                Centre</org> has been established. Besides these major organizations, there are
            clinics in <place reg="Calcutta, India">Calcutta</place>, <place reg="Poona, India"
                >Poona</place>, <place reg="Mysore City, India">Mysore City</place>, and <place
                reg="Bangalore, India">Bangalore</place>, which are developing slowly but with great
            promise for the future.</p>
        <p>Immediately upon my arrival in India, I addressed a large public meeting under the
            auspices of Dr. Pillay's organization, and spoke before a specially convened meeting of
            the <org reg="Municipal Corporation of Bombay">Corporation of Bombay</org> with the
            <person reg="Nariman, K.F.">Mayor</person> in the Chair. I also showed the technical films I had with me to a meeting of 500
            doctors, and gave a radio address which was widely broadcast from the Bombay Station on
                “<title>What Birth Control Can Do For India</title>.”</p>
        <p>The two films on “<title>The Biology of Conception</title>” helped materially in
            explaining the practical side of contraception. One covered the chemical aspects of
            contraception and the other the mechanical aspects. These films were made under the
            direction of Dr. <person reg="Stone, Abraham">Abraham Stone</person> and the supervision
            of Dr. <person reg="Chambers, Robert">Robert Chambers</person> of <org>New York
                University</org>, and the photography was done by <person reg="Grand, Nicholas"
                >Nicholas Grand</person> and his <person reg="Unidentified">brother</person>.</p>
        <p>The birth control resolution passed the All India Women's Conference by a vote of 85 to
            24. The discussion preceding its passage showed that the Indian women are equipped with
            knowledge of this and other related subjects. Almost all of the people who attended
            spoke English. Women came from the <place reg="Punjab, India">Punjab</place> and <place
                reg="Kashmir, India">Kashmir</place> bringing babies with them--the courtyards were
            filled with babies, infants, and children. Some of these women had read much and taken
            five or six weeks to prepare papers, hoping to read them at the Conference. Many went
            away disappointed. Withdrawal of the opposition was accomplished by the Indian Women in
            an unusual way: The same old arguments of morality, immorality, etc., were advanced. The
            last speaker in favor of the resolution capped the climax when she said, “<q who="UNK">I
                am the mother of five children. I have never heard so much said about the 'lusts'
                and 'passion' of men as I have heard here from unmarried women this morning</q>.” A
            few Roman Catholic women withdrew from the Conference because of the resolution, and the
                <person reg="Cousins, Margaret Elizabeth">chairman</person> told them they were
            doing the right thing. “<q who="COUMA">If you stay we will all suffer from discord</q>,”
            she said. “<q who="COUMA">It is better that you go</q>.”</p>
        <p>In addition to the films on “The Biology of Conception,” I took with me to India a large
            quantity of supplies, among other things gyneplacques (models of the female reproductive
            organs), which were a great help to the doctors. The medicine doll is still used
            extensively in India. In general, the doctor cannot see his women patients, but must
            send in to the patient and the midwife the medicine doll, on which the attendant marks
            the place where the pain is felt. I left supplies and equipment at about 50 places,
            where, I am promised, centers for the teaching and dissemination of birth control
            information will be formed.</p>
        <p>In the villages where 95 per cent of the people do not earn more than 5 cents per day and
            97 per cent of the people do not have more than one full meal a day, there is naturally
            a very low standard of living. Here I advised the use of a formula which has been tried
            out in <place>Florida</place>. Its chief ingredient is rice, and it seems practicable,
            therefore, for the <place>Orient</place>. I presented it tentatively, with the
            understanding that we had not thoroughly tested it in our <org
                reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">Research Bureau</org>. Much interest
            was aroused because of its cheapness, and it is being tried out under the auspices of
            public health officers in Bombay and <place reg="Hong Kong, China">Hong
            Kong</place>.</p>
        <p>In addition to the All India Women's Conference, I addressed 64 meetings, and conferred
            with scores of government and city officials--governors, mayors, magistrates, health
            directors, heads of hospitals and other public and private institutions. Some idea of
            the ground covered may be gleaned from the fact that I traveled 10,000 miles in 10
            weeks. Mrs. <person reg="How-Martyn, Edith">Edith How-Martyn</person>, Director of the
                <org>Birth Control International Information Centre</org> (<place
                reg="London, England">London</place>), who was also in India, addressed 41 meetings
            and traveled 6,5000 miles. Thirty-two of all these meetings were before medical groups.
            In this way it was possible to reach the doctors and carry on a medical campaign first.
            This is, I believe, preferable to the way the movement developed in America, where the
            public was appealed to first and the medical campaign followed. If anything will bring
            about the practice of contraception in India, it will be the fact that 34 medical
            societies are willing to do something about birth control in their public practice.</p>
        <p>The <org reg="All-India Medical Conference">All India Medical Conference</org> passed the
            following resolution without a dissentient vote: “<q who="AIMC">This Conference
                recommends that instruction in Contraception Control Methods should form part of the
                curriculum in Medical Colleges and Schools</q>.” Among the other medical groups
            addressed were the first <org>All India Conference of Gynecologists and
                Obstetricians</org> and the annual meeting of the <org><place
                    reg="Tinnevelly, India">Tinnevelly</place> Medical Association</org>.</p>
        <p>Among the most interesting events of my stay in India were my visits to <person
                reg="Tagore, Rabindranath">Rabindranath Tagore</person> and to <person
                reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K.">Mahatma Gandhi</person>. Dr. Tagore is very much in favor
            of birth control. It was an inspiration to see how well he understands the needs of
            women and the suffering they have to endure, and to realize his vision of what women
            could do if they were free and able to take an equal share with men in the control of
            human activities. Once again, and even more than before, I was charmed with Dr. Tagore's
            personality and with his broad, human viewpoint.</p>
        <p>I spent two days with Gandhi at his Ashram in <place reg="Wardha, India">Wardha</place>,
            and had many inspiring conversations and walks with him at sunrise and sunset. Mr.
            Gandhi has practically stepped out of politics, but is deeply loved by the people. Many
            women are devoted to him and have sacrificed much to join his crusade. The public
            attitude on birth control has been indirectly helped by Gandhi's work because he has
            roused the younger generation to a realization of its own worth. Gandhi is, I believe,
            receptive to the principles of birth control but, like many other Indians, he believes
            that all his country's problems would solve themselves if <place>Great Britain</place>
            would only withdraw.</p>
        <p>In <place reg="Alahabad, India">Alahabad</place> I stayed with a family in which there
            were three little girls, aged 9, 7, and 5, beautifully reared in a family of culture and
            refinement. The little girl aged 5 asked her father, “<q who="UNK">If you had met
                Margaret Sanger before I was born, would I be here now</q>?” Her father answered,
                “<q who="UNK">Yes, you would be here; you are here because we wanted you</q>.”</p>
        <p>The birth control movement must go on until every parent in India, in
                <place>America</place>, in every country in the world, is able to make such an
            answer to his children.</p>
