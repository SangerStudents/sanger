        <p>I wonder how many of you here tonight realize just how significant
            this gathering really is? How many of you realize that this meeting
            of intelligent, representative citizens brought together by an
            interest in birth control represents ten years of struggle and
            effort. <emph rend="underline">Ten years</emph>: Ten years of
            battling against ignorance and predjuice. A ten year fight for the
            right to get people to talk and to think about the greatest problem
            that confronts the human race.</p>
        <p>For there are few subjects which have so large a practical
            significance and at the same time cut so deeply into the foundations
            of social evolution as birth control.</p>
        <p>There are few other questions of equal importance left so long in
            equal obscurity and yet none perhaps which can show so unequalled a
            leap in our social vista as birth control has done in so brief a
            period of time.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago to utter the words was looked upon as a crime. To
            champion the right of millions and millions of enslaved mothers
            meant an inditment. the whole subject was taboo. It was almost a
            crime to think of the words.</p>
        <p>Even three years ago as you most you remember, a meeting at the town
            hall was illegally broken up at the instigation of our enemies. We
            have had to fight every inch of the way. We have had to fight for
            peaceable and serious discussions of this momentous subject. Tonight
            the very fact that we are permitted to assemble here unmollested is
            in itself a great victory.</p>
        <p>There are two fundamental reasons for the popular and growing
            interest in birth control and these are:</p>
        <p rend="blockquote">That civilization is confronted with two serious
            problems.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote">That of the pressure of population upon the food
            supply.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote">That of reconciling humanisation with race
            improvement.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote">Many of believe that birth control is the key to
            them both.</p>
        <p>Mark Twain said. “<q who="TWAMA">Everybody talks about the weather
                but no one ever seems to <del>ever</del> do any thing about
                it.</q>”</p>
        <p>Well, the <org>American Birth Control League </org>has been, and is,
            doing something about these problems.</p>
        <p>We know that words, theories, setiments and sympathies are all very
            good in themselves but we have got to have intelligent thinking and
            put it into intelligent action.</p>
        <p>If the program for birth control is to grow, to expand, if it is even
            to hold the ground it has gained thru these years of untold
            sacrifice, of often seemingly hopeless effort we must have
            cooperation. We must have courageous active cooperation. Not alone
            of individuals but of organizations and of those who accept the
            truth of birth control -- but do nothing about it.</p>
        <p>We need more English courage injected in the intellectual life of
            America. We need the kind of intellectual courage such as has been
            shown by Dean <person reg="Inge, William Ralph">Inge</person>,
                <person reg="Shaw, George Bernard">Bernard Shaw</person>,
                <person reg="Wells, H.G.">H.G. Wells</person>, <person
                reg="Keynes, John Maynard">John Maynard Keynes</person> and Lord
                <person reg="Dawson, Bertrand">Dawson of Penn</person>, the
            king's physician. These men have had the courage to publicly express
            their private convictions. They have never lost in the estimation of
            the British public by so doing.</p>
        <p>The American Birth Control League is calling for the
            cooperation of the medical profession, for scientific research, for
            investigation and unbiased study. We continue to point out how birth
            control is the very pivot of all social problems - - problems of
            child welfare as well as of national health.</p>
        <p>We are trying to make the world safe for babies. We insist that
            sympathy, charity, pallative legislation is not enough. That milk
            stations are not enough. That maternity centers are not enough. That
            child labor laws are not enough.</p>
        <p>If you could look into the faces of some of the parents whose
            children labor laws are trying to protect you would see that they
            are not enough. You would see that such parents has not sufficient
            earning power to provide for their own existence to say nothing of
            providing for the eight or ten children that they have already
            borne. When children are born of such parents and under such
            conditions neccesity forces them to work as soon as they can toddle
            -- or to die. Child labor laws are not enough and children of such
            parents should never be born.</p>
        <p>Societies for the prevention of cruelty to children are not enough.
            We want to prevent the cruelty of children being born in cruelty.
            Could anything be more cruel than to be born in disease, ignorance,
            misery.</p>
        <p>If we are to make this world safe for childhood, safe for future
            generations, safe for civilization we have got to check the endless
            stream of unwanted death doomed children. This stream can not be
            swept back with the broom of pallative legislation -- nor with the
            feather duster of organised charity. It must be checked at the
            source by birth control.</p>
