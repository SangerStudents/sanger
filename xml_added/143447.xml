        <p/>
        <p>"A case a case – My kingdom for a case" were the words which rang through the room, where
            several nurses were gathered one afternoon in June. The words were uttered by a small,
            fair and healthy specimen of the female sex, and tilting her nose a trifle more, if
            possible than it was naturally inclined, threw the stockings she was darning from her,
            gathered her knees within her folded hands and continued: "No joking girls, its three
            weeks to day since Ive had a case, and tomorrow not only my rent here is due, but –" she
            was interrupted by the telephone – "yes, – yes, certainly, Ill take it, Ill go right
            down good bye" She turned from the phone, and the light in her eyes, the expression of
            happiness on her face, made one who saw it, say what a pretty girl she is. "Lucky Dog"
            said the girls in a chorus, "Where is it"? said one. "What is it?" said another, "No
            time for questions girls, I must don my best togs and see if I can cinch that job – get
            out of here all of you and come back later on I must dress." A half hour later, she was
            neatly attired, boarding a down town car in her hand was a card upon which was written
            the address of the Physician who wanted an office nurse.</p>
        <p>She arrived at the address given "ah yes she thought, I expected a brown stone front well
            so be it, now <person reg="Taylor, Peggy">Peggy Taylor</person> smile your prettiest". A
            colored butler took her card, told her to be seated but before she had time to glance at
            her surroundings, the Dr. stood before her, in operating gown, "Ah Miss Taylor yes Im
            glad to see you, Yes I want an assistant nurse, one who is capable and understands her
            business, I require a certificate of health, a reference from two reliable Physicians,
            and your Hospital diploma, I wish it understood that I pay well for your services Miss
            Taylor, twenty-five dollars a week and board, five dollars for every operation done
            outside, and two and a half for all done in the house, we average ten operations a day"
            At this information she beamed happiness, her heart beat so loudly she straightened in
            her chair to get control of herself; he saw the look and was satisfied, yes he thought
            to himself, she will do nicely. "Is there anything you do not understand Miss Taylor?
            very well, then if you wish to accept the position bring the required references at ten
            A.M. tomorrow and consider yourself engaged." He arose, shook hands in a most business
            like way, ushered her to the door, closed it after her, watched her as she boarded an
            uptown car, smiled as only he could smile, and went back to his work.</p>
        <p>Peggy had no knowledge of when she got back to her room, she had known what it was to be
            happy, but never before had she been so favored by the gods that she called herself
            "lucky" until now. "Me" she said aloud, "me Peg Taylor to fall into such luck, and what
            a dress Ill give to Kit for her graduation, – Ill write at once to mother and tell her
            about it," she wrote the following:</p>
        <p>Dear dearest mother mine: Stop that garden work get a man to do it for you, and Ill pay
            him, or get one to peddle the milk and let father do the garden work, delay your trip to
            New Haven until my next letter, when I shall send you money enough to buy a new dress
            for yourself and one for Kit, I want her graduation dress to be a real dress Muddy dear,
            a point de spirit over silk with baby ribbon, would be right, I should think, oh I'M so
            happy. Dont you worry about that horrid old mortgage and note which fall due soon, for
            I'm coining money. Will write to you about it later on, love to all the kiddies and be
            happy, your devoted Peggie.</p>
        <p>She finished writing this and with pen upraised she sat pondering for a moment then
            brought forth another sheet of paper and wrote:</p>
        <p>Dear old Dick; Yours rec'd, if I had answered it yesterday as I was inclined to do, you
            should have had "yes" for an answer instead of the one I am going to give to you to
            day.</p>
        <p>Dick for three weeks I have not earned one cent, all the nurses were desperate, I have
            had only a few cases so far this spring and short ones too. I was foolish to come to
                <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> when I did summer is always bad so I am
            told. Yesterday I felt I could keep it up no longer and was strongly tempted to shake it
            all of and go back to the farm and – be – yours.; but the thought of the mortgage due
            shortly, of mother bending over the strawberry bed trying to sell enough to make ends
            meet, the thought of the thousand little things needed for those little [ones] and I
            their only hope, – I thought of all these Dick and I just could not give up; but today I
            am well rewarded, for Yours truly is to be [assistant] to a M. D. and you Dick dear must
            be content to wait, oh, just a little longer and then Ill be forever your Peg.</p>
        <p>She caressingly sealed this letter, took her hat and gloves and departed to get the
            required references. Let me see there is Dr. Clark, yes Ill go to him I nursed his wife
            and sick baby and he will be glad to hear of the turn of fortune Ive had. She had not
            long to wait before she was telling this great specialist of the wonderfol opportunity
            before her and the part he was to have in her realization of it.</p>
        <p>This man of experience looked at her fondly as he would a child he hesitated to dampen
            the spirits of this happy girl, and yet he was suspicious of the location, and urged her
            to delay going there until he could find out for her a little more concerning this
            generous Physician who was not registered among the legitimates.</p>
        <p>She laughed at his concern and called him "stupid" assured him she was capable of judging
            conditions better than he was as she had seen the person in question and if he would
            just jot down a few words which would serve as a reference, she would be off and not
            trouble him again, – until she wanted something else. At which they both laughed, and
            she is soon on her way to the general practitioner where she obtained the required
            health certificate and reference. Back again to her little room to say good bye to this
            "dinky box" and dream the dreams which should have come true to so faithful generous and
            loyal a girl. She had not long to dream however for she was soon aroused from her
            reveries by a loud knocking at the door, and girls voices saying "hallo Taylor, let us
            in – Say did you get the Job? bully for you. Tell us about it. She told them simply. "Ye
            gods!" said one girl a Miss Ryan "was ever such luck. Ill give you fair warning girls if
            I dont get a case in twenty-four hours Ill marry – a street cleaner." "Indeed," said
            Miss Willets a auburn haired girl with a twinkle in her eye who was a staunch Suffragist
            "You'd have done that long ago had you the slightest opportunity."</p>
        <p>Well" said Miss Ryan "so would you Willie if you were on twenty four hour duty, with a
            typhoid for six weeks without one cent, and then after you had pulled this living
            skeleton out of the jaws of – well it might be presumption on my part to say just where,
            but the nerve of [those] people to refuse to pay me twenty five dollars a week, to
            question the right of a Woman to demand such a price, and Willie you" – "Oh yes, of
            course," interrupted Miss Willetts "they dispute your right they question your price but
            would they dare to question a Doctor? Would they refuse a man the salary he asks? No"
            she continued, "rising from the bed on which she was sitting, they would not dare to,
            but we Women, – we are so alone and foolishly divided, that not until we demand our
            rights politically, will we be respected in any vocation." </p>
        <p>"Hooray, hooray," cheered the voices "Go on Willie." "keep it up." She was willing to but
            was silenced by the tall figure of the Matron of the Registry, who had knocked several
            times and receiving no response – walked in. She smiled as she heard the closing words
            of the enthusiastic orator, upon seeing Miss Daly who was next on the list, informed her
            she had been called by Dr. Russell for an obstetrical case, to report at once. A groan
            from the croud, "beat it Daly" and "twins for yours". She was off. The Matron told Miss
            Ryan to get her bag ready, for it was her turn next. "Ready, why Mrs Robinson Ive been
            ready for weeks" They all laughed and the Matron, a kindly woman of middle age, left
            them to their follies.</p>
        <p>Miss Willetts had not forgotten her subject, she began; "No Ryan there is no use in
            kicking about abuses, here and there, the first thing all working women must do is to
            Organize, do you hear girls, to organize Thats the first step out of the darkness for
            Women."</p>
        <p>"Why look at us, we nurses do practally all the work in many cases, and what do we get
            out of it? We pay, first five dollars to belong to a Registry, then out of every case we
            pay the Registry ten per cent, on all our earnings, and our room rent and telephone,
            figure it up how much we get out of it. We do the work thats the point, and what right
            has these parasitical registrys to take ten percent, or any percent? Why not work
            together, have one Central Registry, where all nurses [register] and any Doctor wanting
            a nurse can call for one there, how much more economical, think of the three hundred or
            more registrys with there three hundred telephones, clerks, and other encumbrences, and
            a Doctor not knowing where to get a nurse, and hundreds of nurses hanging in the air
            lots of them on the verge of starvation waiting for a call.</p>
        <p>Isn't it foolish? Why even Taylor, the Innocent from Conn. can see it cant you Hon?" "If
            you mean me Miss Willetts," said Miss Taylor, "I can see that point all right, but I can
            not understand why you are so hard on the Matrons of the Registrys, they must do
            something in order to live, why not that?" "Yes" said the Suffragist sarcastically,
            "they must live that [is] true, but dont you, personally find it rather expensive
            charity? Could not such an intelligent woman as Mrs. Robinson for instance, be doing
            something worth while? and I dare say if you talk to her you will find she is longing to
            do something, some service to humanity. Instead of this monotonous existence."</p>
        <p>Say Willie," said Miss Ryan, who had been closing her eyes in boredom "if ever you get a
            patient with insomnia, reel off that rot you just gave us and he will either be cured,
            or he will be compelled to change his residence, – to Bellview. For heaven's sake, cut
            it out and let us hear about Taylors case." "Is he handsome Peggy?" said Miss Willetts.
            "Well Yes and no." "Thats a bad sign to begin with," "cant you say which?" said Miss
            Willetts. Peggy thought a minute and then said "no I cant just tell, he has a peculiar
            face, but Im not going to disect his looks until I know him better. All I know is its a
            good job girls and I need the money" "Thats true" Said Miss Willetts "but are you sure
            everything is straight down there? You are such a kid in some things Peggy, and yet –
            and yet" she said thoughtfully, "I sometimes think it is your innocense which somehow
            protects you." "Perfect nonsense," said Miss Taylor "Im sure he is a [gentleman], – he's
            very courteous – , and even if he isnt, nurses must stand the cross and dissagreeable,
            as well as the polite people."</p>
        <p>So they chatted and discussed the problems that trouble the thinking people of all
            nations, until bed time, when wishing each other good night and Peggy good luck, they
            left her; she threw herself upon her knees and poured out her heart felt thanks to the
            Great Unknown for this happiness this great and beautiful happiness, of being able to do
            for others, and especially for those we love – so she slept the sleep that only youth
            and a clear conscience can sleep.</p>
        <p>The next morning promptly at ten she found herself again at the brown stone front, but
            instead of the dark butler, the Doctor himself opened [the] door for her, he was
            immaculately dressed, hair almost shone, mustache curled, which together with the pink
            carnation in his coat lapel, made her say "dandy" to her self. He bowed low and long
            over her hand, not quite the business air of the day before.</p>
        <p>"Allow me to assist you" he said as he took her suitcase, and leading the way through the
            house, he summoned Mrs Thomas, the house keeper, and George the butler, introduced her
            to them saying, "This is your future Mistress Miss Taylor, hereafter she is to be
            consulted concerning affairs of the house, and I wish it understood that her wishes are
            mine." She followed him up the soft luxurious stairs through this house of elegance, to
            a large spacious, elegantly furnished room the sight of which made her heart beat for
            joy; he pushed open the door, allowed her to enter, put the bag inside The Door, and
            quickly stepped inside and closed the door. She held her breath a moment not daring to
            think; then he spoke; "This is your room Miss Taylor, you like this color?" He watched
            her closely, "these flowers I had sent in for you to day, these books are yours, in
            fact, little one the desires of your life shall be filled in my house, you are mistress
            of this entire place," stepping to her side he said softly, "this is your little bed
            sweetheart," and stepping to a screen on the other side of the bed pulled it back "and
            this is mine" he said pointing to another bed which the screen had so cunningly
            hidden.</p>
        <p>During all this conversation she had stood as one petrified but at these last words she
            gave one blood curdling scream, and rushed for the door, he was there before her, caught
            her by the throat and roughly pushed her against the closed door. "You little Devil" he
            hissed, "what are you here for? Do you mean to say you did not know what you were coming
            here for? Ha ha, then here you've come and here you'll stay, Miss – Scream, kick, cry to
            your hearts delight, for no one shall heed you," he thundered. At these terrible words
            the blood left her face, her knees trembled, for she at last realized into what a demons
            den she had come.- She had seen men in joy, sorrow, agony and death, but this was her
            first experience at seeing a living devil smile. But at that smile the fighting blood of
            her New England ancestors, arose in her, she knew a time had come to fight, and fight to
            the death, –rather than that.</p>
        <p>Quicker than it takes to tell, these thoughts flashed through her mind, she raised her
            head, looked him square between the eyes, and said: "Doctor, I have one thing to say,
            You are mistaken in me. I am not that kind of woman. I came here innocently. I wish to
            go away. Look into my face, look closely, and should you see in that look other than
            -Purity, then God help me." At these words he came closer, anger and passion fighting
            for posession, "You lie" he said "You lie, you huzzy, you have come [here] to spy, you
            have come here pretending innocense, to pry into my work, but your game won't work with
            me; Listen," he said hoarsley "Look you into my eyes" Oh, God that horrible face! "and
            learn what power is; it is greater than the purity which you claim is in yours; one word
            from me and into this house you'd remain, until I gave the word to release you; a word
            from me and to the workhouse you would go – as a prostitute; Yes I have that much power,
            and more far more; Think little fool, could I run an establishment of this kind without
            power? Could I preform from ten to twenty operations a day, without power? Could I?" He
            screamed. "No, no, with all your pretended innocense you must know that. And further
            anything you might say of me, would be laughed at, No newspaper in New York City, dare,
            I repeat it, dare, to print what I have told you –Why? Power, – power from on high, high
            in the world of Capital, influence, and prestage, all of whom I have favored, and in
            turn favor me."</p>
        <p>During this time he had released her, much to her releif, and stood a little distance
            from her in order to use his hands, for he jesticulated much, but as he told her of the
            favors he had done his face softened, and came toward her with outstretched arms; Here
            was no longer the frightened bird, here was a woman holding anger and pride in check,
            standing resolutely against the door, head held high, lips tightly closed ready for
            fight, – she had aged five years, since she came into that room, here was something new,
            something worth winning, he thought, his whole being shook with passion as he said,
            "Forgive me, cant you? Your here, you have all to gain by staying here, why make a mess
            of this." He kept coming closer as he spoke, and she felt in another second – it would
            be too late; "Stop!" she cried, as she raised her arm and pointed at him, her eyes
            blazed, her face was pale and drawn "-Stop, I say, not one step nearer; you have had
            your say, now Ill have mine; Im not afraid of you. Your tyranny and boasted power are
            nothing to me.</p>
        <p>"Of one thing I am certain," she said calmly, "I leave this room as pure as I entered it
            or I leave it not at all.</p>
        <p>Your lies about your influece with scoundrels of this City does not frighten me, for I
            too am protected by men who are men – on high, I have back of me the vast army of
            Medical men in United States, two of whom know I came here to day, knowing this I defy
            you to touch me," her turn had come now and all fear had gone.</p>
        <p>At these words and the reliant look of this slip of a girl the coward cringed, he knew
            she spoke the truth; he realized she was not the ordinary girl, and not to be bullied;
            he knew he must give her up, but not until his cruelty had some relief, he folded his
            arms, put his head cunningly on one side and said; "You are not trying to make me
            beleive you are pure are you?" She looked him fully in the eyes and [answered] "I am."
            He changed his position slightly, by shifting the other foot forward, bent forward and
            continued; "Do you mean to tell me you are a virgin"? for one second, she gasped at this
            cruelty, but looked at him [and] said "I do." "Swear it," he thundred, -his right arm
            raised high, his whole being aroused to anger. "I swear," she said, with [her] head
            erect, and eyes dancing fire, she saw she had won; He stepped to the door unlocked it,
            threw it open wide, and shouted "go". She went. Then the air was rent with peal after
            peal of the most diabolical laughter, for a second, her blood seemed to freeze in her
            veins, she put her hands to her ears to shut out that terrible laugh, but the sight of
            her suit case tumbling down the stairs brought her to her senses, and soon she was safe
            outside that den of torture. On, on she plodded, she knew not where, she cared not
            where, she was safe, safe, safe. -that was enough for the present.</p>
        <p>She had won the battle for her soul, Ah, God! was ever such a battle fought! Sometime in
            the afternoon, we see her at the Grand Central Station, buying a ticket for her home
            town. Later we see her walking along the dusty road nearing the farm. At a distance we
            can see a figure bending over a green patch, with sunbonnet pushed far back on her head,
            and we feel it is her mother. Peggy sees her, and a lump comes into her throat as she
            thinks of the dissapointments in store for them all.</p>
        <p>She is soon enfolded in the strong arms of that dear mother, and as they sit together
            under the elm tree, she relates her agonizing experience, to that loyal heart.</p>
        <p>A glance at that New England mother will at once tell us better than words where the
            daughter got her courage and spirit, in time of danger. Proud, brave and tearless, she
            took her daughters face in her hands and said; "Peggy," you are a wonderful girl. I'm
            prouder of you to day, than I ever was of your great grandfather, who fought and died so
            valiently at the battle of Bunker Hill. This unrecorded battle!" she shook her head,
            "and you my Peggy the Victor." They sat thus for some time "Ill not go back again
            Mother, Im so tired, of it all, and Dick has waited so patiently, yes Ive quite decided
            to stay."</p>
        <p>After the house was quite that night, the father and mother walked up and down, the
            kitchen floor, up and down, hour after hour, arm in arm. For miles around this honest
            and sturdy farmer was called Uncle Sam, so vividly did he remind us of our "Uncle
            Sam."</p>
        <p>On, on he walked, up and down far into the dawn, head bent, eyes fixed on the floor,
            fists clenched, thinking, thinking. At last he stopped, went to a shelf, took down a
            rifle he kept there, blew off the dust, wiped it carefully.</p>
