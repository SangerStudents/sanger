        <head>A Victory, A New Year and A New Day</head>
        <byline rend="italics">By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p>The year 1919 is a year of victory. The work for Birth Control is bearing fruit beyond
            our hopes.</p>
        <p>Something more than a mere personal escape from the toils of an outworn legal fiction was
            involved in the dismissal of "obscenity" charges against <person reg="Marion, Kitty"
                >Kitty Marion</person> and myself by Magistrate <person reg="Eilpern, Jacob"
                >Eilpern</person> in <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>, January 18th.
            Our arrest on December 31st, marked the end of the old year-- the end of a day that is
            gone. Our dismissal means it will no longer be so easy for a timorous adherent to
            wornout dogmas, masking himself safely behind an anonymous communication, to interfere
            with Birth Control propaganda.</p>
        <p>This means a freer sweep for our efforts; it means a wider circulation for <title
                type="journal">THE BIRTH CONTROL REVIEW</title>, more co-operation, new courage, new
            effectiveness. In itself, it is enough to bring about for the Birth Control movement a
            new day.</p>
        <p>Part of the evidence submitted to show why we should not be held to trial in a higher
            court consisted of several series of pamphlets on sex matters and venereal disease,
            issued by the <org reg="United States War Department">War Department</org>, the <org
                reg="United States Department of the Navy">Navy Department</org>, the <org>United
                States Public Health Service</org>, which is a branch of the <org
                reg="United States Department of the Treasury">Treasury Department</org>; the <org
                reg="Young Men's Christian Association">Y.M.C.A.</org>, the <org
                reg="Young Women's Christian Association">Y.W.C.A.</org> and the <org>American
                Social Hygiene Association</org>. These pamphlets, distributed by the millions, were
            designed for soldiers, for young men, for parents, and for young women! And some of them
            discussed sex matters with far more frankness than did the article which was complained
            of. Many others looked as if they might have been in large part rewritten from the book,
                "<title type="book">What Every Girl Should Know</title>," which covers exactly the
            same ground as the article which caused the arrest of Miss Marion and myself.</p>
        <p>"<q who="GOLJO">The so-called obscenity statute is of no effect without a standard,</q>"
                Attorney,<person reg="Goldstein, Jonah J.">J.J. Goldstein</person>, told the
                court,"<q who="GOLJO"> What was called obscene yesterday may in the greater light of
                today be found to be clean and pure. The United States government's own publications
                may assuredly be accepted as a standard. Some of these pamphlets are a good deal
                plainer spoken than is Margaret Sanger's article.</q>"</p>
        <p>Since it is not in conflict with the principle of the "obscenity" laws for the federal
            government to print and distribute millions of copies of pamphlets which discuss plainly
            the physiology of sex in men and women in connection with venereal disease, it can
            hardly be in conflict with these statutes to discuss the same matters in connection with
            Birth Control.</p>
        <p>Miss Marion and myself were arrested December 31st by Sergeant <person
                reg="Mooney, Charle P.">Mooney</person> of the Thirty-first street police station,
            New York. He explained that he had received complaints, which he afterwards said were
            anonymous, against the sale of the magazine on Broadway by Miss Marion and other women,
            and against its display upon the newsstands. The basis of the formal complaint was the
            article in the December number entitled "<title type="article">Birth Control or
                Abortion?</title>"</p>
        <p>In that article it was urged that since women limit their families by abortion if by no
            other means, a free, unhindered spreading of the knowledge of scientific Birth Control
            would do away with the appalling number of abortions occurring annually in the
                <place>United States</place>. One authority says there are 1,000,000 each year and
            another puts the figure even higher.</p>
        <p>We were arraigned before Magistrate Eilpern and were released in custody of our attorney.
            Arguments were heard at our next appearance in court and the case taken under advisement
            for a few days. At our third appearance, the magistrate announced that he needed more
            time to consider the case.</p>
        <p> January 18th he dismissed us.</p>
        <p>"<q who="EILJA">I dismiss the charges upon a strict legal ground</q>" said he "<q
                who="EILJA">I am not passing upon the merits of Birth Control propaganda. The
                Appellate Division held in the <person reg="Mindell, Fania">Mindell</person> case
                that Margaret Sanger's book, "<title type="book">What Every Girl Should
                Know</title>" was not obscene, reversing the decision of the <org>Court of Special
                    Sessions</org>, which had convicted. This is the same matter that is involved in
                the present article. On that ground alone, I dismiss these charges.</q>"</p>
        <p>The case would seem to dispose of the "obscenity" statute so far as Birth Control
            propaganda in the state of New York is concerned. The issuance of the "venereal disease"
            pamphlets by the federal government- - the same pamphlets are also being distributed by
            the New York state department of health--answers objections of masculine-minded puritans
            who still believe that women can be kept pure through ignorance. At last the state and
            the nation have come to a more enlightened standard.</p>
        <p>Not only have they come to accept this standard, but, alarmed by the terrible results of
            ignorance to the individual and the state they are insisting upon the light.</p>
        <p>They want the light through pamphlets, magazines, the public schools--through all the
            means of getting light upon sex matters.</p>
        <p>In a pamphlet entitled "<title type="book">The Problem of Sex Education in
                Schools</title>" issued by the United States Public Health Service, distributed by
            both that service and the <org reg="New York Bureau of Venereal Disease">Bureau of
                Venereal Disease of New York</org> state health department, this statement is
            made:</p>
        <p>"<q who="USPHS">It (sex education) includes the whole process of reproduction and nurture
                of children, the meaning of marriage, prostitution, venereal diseases, illegitimacy
                and hygiene of sound recreation. These cannot be taught at any one time or
                place.</q>"</p>
        <p>In the same pamphlet, bearing as it does the imprint of the <org>United States
                government</org> and of the <org>State of New York</org>, this indictment of the ban
            on sex knowledge is set forth:</p>
        <p>"<q who="USPHS">In planning to include sex education in the school curriculum it should
                be realized that sex in life is not isolated as an experience or as a group of
                facts. It winds through many kinds of experiences at different ages and is a part of
                many kinds of facts. Few branches of knowledge or feeling do not touch sex problems.
                Few subjects can be taught properly with the sex aspects left out. <emph
                    rend="italics">An examination of the curriculum shows that society has had an
                    official censor deleting sex from all classroom work under the orders of a now
                    outworn prudery</emph>. We find sex left out of all subjects no matter how much
                the omission weakens or even falsifies them. In nature study begin with the baby
                animal and end with the death, giving no account of the renewal process; in anatomy
                while three bodily cavities are named, the organs in only two are fully enumerated;
                in contagious diseases venereal diseases are omitted; in the selections from
                literature the sex motives are suppressed; in history and civics their significance
                is ignored.</q>"</p>
        <p>If any word of rebuke to the suppressors of sex knowledge remained to be said, it was
            contained in "<title type="book">Facts for Young Women</title>," a pamphlet issued by
            the <org>New York State Department of Health</org>, under the signature of Dr. <person
                reg="Biggs, Hermann M.">Hermann M. Biggs</person>, the commissioner. After
            describing some of the horrors that have resulted from ignorance of sexual functions,
            the writer says:</p>
        <p><q who="BIGHE">
                <emph rend="italics">"Is it not time, with our knowledge of these facts, that
                    something should be done to change this deplorable condition? Is it not time
                    that women should look the sex problem squarely in the face, devoid of mystery
                    and so-called 'moral issues.' from a practical and common sense point of view?
                    Is it not time that all girls and young women, the future mothers of the race,
                    should know the truth about the reproductive organs and the diseases which may
                    effect them, so as to preserve their health and that of their offspring?</emph>
            </q></p>
        <p><q who="BIGHE"><emph rend="italics">It is the object of this booklet to teach young women
                    some of the facts which they should know about these vital
            things</emph>.</q>"</p>
        <p>The world moves and America moves with it. Six or seven years ago the post office
            department held up copies of "<title type="book">What Every Girl Should Know</title>" as
            unmailable. Only after a considerable difficulty were the department authorities
            convinced that there was no violation of the federal laws in sending these books through
            the mails. Now these are court decisions upholding our contention as to the character of
            such books.</p>
        <p>There are still federal laws against the mailing of contraceptive information. Many
            states have laws too against communicating this information. Reactionaries still use
            these statutes to prevent the enlightenment of women and the freeing of them from the
            burden of too frequent child bearing. But the time is coming--perhaps sooner than some
            of us can believe-- when these mediaeval legal monstrosities will follow others of their
            kind to the dustbin.</p>
