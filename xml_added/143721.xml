        <head>A Program of Contraceptive Research</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <div type="section">
            <p>The Birth Control Movement has two practical objectives. The first is to develop,
                through scientific research, the most healthful, sanitary, efficient, simple and
                inexpensive contraceptive methods. The second is to make it possible, through the
                education of public opinion and the liberalization of antiquated legislation, to
                convey the knowledge of those methods to all who need it.</p>
            <p>This memorandum will deal with the problems of research only. I will briefly outline
                the need of a more extensive research program, and then I will indicate how in my
                opinion that program may best be carried out, and what it would probably cost.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">The Need.</head>
            <p>All Medical authorities agree that no completely satisfactory contraceptive methods
                have as yet been devised, and that the ultimate success of the Birth Control
                movement depends to a large extent on developing, through research, contraceptive
                methods that will be so simple, so safe, so convenient and so cheap that the
                popularization of their use among poor and ignorant people will be a comparatively
                easy matter. Research in this field would be of two sorts: laboratory work, and the
                collection, correlation and analysis of data.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Laboratory Work.</head>
            <p>In this country the only individuals who, to my knowledge, are conducting laboratory
                work in this field are as follows:</p>
            <p><person reg="Guyer, Michael Frederic">Dr. Guyer</person> and two of his colleagues,
                at the <org>University of Wisconsin</org>, who are conducting experiments in
                spermatoxins; <person reg="Evans, Herbert Maclean">Dr. Evans</person> of the
                    <org>University of California</org>, who is at work on the segregation of
                vitamin E, the elimination of which from the diet may possibly affect fertility,
                although but little is known about it as yet; <person reg="Hooker, Donald R.">Dr.
                    Hooker</person> of the <org>Johns Hopkins University</org>, who has done some
                experiments with the X-ray in relation to temporary sterilization, but has found
                that this method is too radical for human application; and <person
                    reg="Little, Clarence Cook">Dr. Little</person>, President of the
                    <org>University of Michigan</org>, who has also done experiments with X-ray
                along the same line, and is positive that this method cannot safely be used.</p>
            <p>These men are working independently of each other, and none of them is addressing
                himself primarily to the task of developing practical contraceptives for public use.
                For our purposes, therefore, there may be said to be no real laboratory research at
                present in this country, although it is possible that some of the work described
                above may ultimately yield practical results of the sort we desire.</p>
            <p>So far as I know, there is also no real laboratory research in <place>Europe</place>
                in this field - with one important exception. At my instigation, Dr. <person
                    reg=" Crew, Francis Albert Eley">F. A. E. Crew</person>, chief of the <org
                    reg="Edinburgh University Department of Zoology">Department of Zoology of
                    Edinburgh University</org>, and one of the leading European scientists, has
                opened a laboratory for contraceptive research, and has brought over from
                    <place>Germany</place> as his assistant <person reg="Wiesner, Bertold Paul">Dr.
                    Weisner</person>, a well-known associate of the great <person
                    reg="Steinach, Eugen">Steinach</person>. They have mapped out a three-year
                program. They will experiment with various serums, glandular preparations, and other
                spermatoxins, using monkeys, guinea pigs and other animals, and extending their
                experiments over a number of generations. They are hopeful that many men and women
                now working in clinics in <place>Scotland</place> and <place reg="London, England"
                    >London</place> will co-operate with them in their experiments. <del>Their
                    program, which they have very carefully worked out, is budgeted to cost them
                    approximately $10,000. a year for the three years. I have pledged myself to try
                    to raise half that amount for them in this country.</del></p>
            <p>Altogether this projected work of Dr. Crew and Dr. Weisner is, in my opinion, by all
                odds the most important research undertaking in our particular field anywhere in the
                world.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Collection correlation and analysis of data.</head>
            <p>Research along these lines is essential. At present there is no tabulated data on a
                large enough scale to be conclusive, that shows the actual results of the use of
                different contraceptives, their successes and failures and their social
                implications. Here and there scattered material of a limited sort has been published
                in this country; but as yet we are largely groping in the dark.</p>
            <p>Fortunately there is available a volume of data in this country that I believe would
                prove of the highest importance if it were properly analyzed. I refer to the records
                of the <org reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">Clinical Research
                    Department</org> of the <org>American Birth Control League</org>. I will give a
                brief history of this Department in order to explain the nature of these
                records.</p>
            <p>The Department was organized in 1924 to give Birth Control information to mothers who
                applied for it, and who came within the provisions of the law, and to study
                contraceptive methods and related problems. Beginning with a staff of three,
                consisting of a physician, a Clinical secretary and a social worker, the staff now
                consists of four doctors (two each day), three nurses, a social worker, and (for
                Jewish and Polish mothers) an assistant social worker, and a secretary, and in
                addition, nine directors, of whom five are medical men and four are scientists, and
                all of whom are actively associated in directing the policies and research work of
                the Clinic.</p>
            <p>Up to very recently the Clinic, which is located at 46 West 15th Street, <place
                    reg="New York, NY">New York City</place> has consisted of a large reception
                room, an adjacent smaller room which is used as a nursery and playground for
                children whose mothers are being examined, a room where the secretary interviews the
                patient and notes her history, a consultation room for the physician, and an
                examining and treatment room. Within the last few months we have added a new floor,
                which will give us another large reception room, two examining rooms, and an
                interview room. In spite of this expansion of space, and even if we can obtain the
                funds to add the necessary doctors, nurses and secretary, our facilities will still
                be overtaxed, for more and more mothers, many of them in desperate need, are coming
                to us, and frequently all our available appointments are filled up two weeks in
                advance. Last year we gave contraceptive advice to 4,521 women; this year the number
                will be much larger, as every month marks an increase. The figure above does not
                represent all of the women who applied, for many were turned away because they did
                not present a sufficient “health reason” to permit contraceptive information to be
                legally given.</p>
            <p>With respect to each mother interviewed (including some of those turned away) a
                history chart is filled out by the secretary, giving among other things her <emph
                    rend="underline">social</emph> history (nationality and religion; husband’s
                occupation, health, income and habits; her own income, education, intelligence, and
                so forth) habits; her own income, education, intelligence, and so forth) her <emph
                    rend="underline">sex</emph> history (age at first pregnancy, number of years
                married, of children living and dead, of miscarriages and whether accidental,
                therapeutic or self-induced, the character of her labors, whether contraceptives
                used and how long, ect., ect.) And her physical condition (including pelvic
                measurements, ect.)</p>
            <p>Each patient is requested to return at the end of six weeks to report her results
                with the prescribed method, and to be re-examined. Further reports are requested at
                internals of three months. The social worker and her assistant carefully follows up
                the return visits of the cases, and whenever possible home visits are made to
                delinquent patients in an effort to be of further assistance to them and to obtain
                fuller information as to the results of the advice and methods prescribed.</p>
            <p>From all of this follow-up work, we obtain detailed information, which is noted on
                the charts, as to the relative successes and failures of the various sorts of
                contraceptives which we prescribe, the effects of their use on the patients’ health
                and home conditions, and the reasons for their abandonment (husband’s objections,
                inconvenience, improvement in health, etc.) in those cases where they have ceased to
                be used.</p>
            <p>We now have <emph rend="underline">over ten thousand</emph> of these individual
                history charts, each one of which is a mine of information, and all of which, taken
                together, if properly correlated and analyzed, would be of inestimable social and
                scientific value. With our already over-taxed staff we have had neither the time nor
                the funds to make the necessary analysis. A superficial examination of the charts
                reveals the significant facts that almost as many Catholic mothers have applied to
                us as Jewish or Protestant, that over 70% of the families represented earn less than
                $50. per week, that frequently those with the least incomes have the largest number
                of children, and that the number of induced abortions among the poorer class of
                mothers with large families is enormous. In the year 1925, for instance, out of a
                group of less than 2,000 women, 1,434 induced abortions were admitted, varying from
                one to as many as forty abortions in one particular case. When we consider that
                women generally are afraid and reluctant to admit the occurrence of induced
                abortions, the total given above undoubtedly underestimates the actual number.</p>
            <p>But these are only a few of the things we need to know. We need to know the relative
                efficiency of the various contraceptive methods, and the effects of their use on
                health, sex relations, and economic status; the relation of the infant death rate to
                the number of children and of pregnancies; the relation of births and of infant
                deaths to the size of the family income; the frequency of induced abortions related
                to economic status, number of children and other factors; the sex history and
                physical condition of women in relation to the number of their pregnancies, size of
                their families and so on; the attitudes of husbands to various contraceptive methods
                and to what extent the husband’s occupation, personal habits, religion, etc. are
                factors in determining the wife’s condition. These and kindred matters must be made
                known before we can advance much further. I am convinced that a thorough and
                intelligent analysis of our charts is the most immediately practical step that can
                be taken in Birth Control research, for I know of no other body of information that
                contains such important and illuminating personal and social details.</p>
            <p>I believe that the proposed analysis, when published, would not only advance the
                whole science of Birth Control, but would have other indirect results of almost
                equal importance: (1) It should stimulate the formation of other Clinics. <del>The
                    American Birth Control League, a</del>
                <add>A</add>fter long and arduous effort, has succeeded in getting Clinics <add>have
                    been</add> organized in <place reg="Los Angeles, CA">Los Angeles</place>, <place
                    reg="Baltimore, MD">Baltimore</place>, <place reg="Detroit, MI">Detroit</place>,
                    <place reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</place> and <place reg="Cleveland, OH"
                    >Cleveland</place><del>.</del>
                <add>but</add> Their number is still pitifully small and they mark only the
                beginning of our attempt to have the problems adequately dealt with throughout the
                country. I believe that the publication of our findings would be of enormous
                educative value, especially among sociological and medical groups whose support is
                so necessary to the advance of the movement. (2) It would assist us materially, I
                think, in making our legislative campaigns more effective, because we would be able
                to point to a body of facts so large and so striking that no one could explain it
                away. (3) It would almost certainly lead to a more detailed, careful and uniform
                system of data-taking and fact-finding on the part of similar clinics and even on
                the part of donors. (4) By showing the relative faults and merits of different
                contraceptives, it would stimulate and guide laboratory research.</p>
            <p>The employment of a properly trained secretary to do this work under our supervision,
                the cost of stenographic assistance, and the publication of the final results, would
                in my opinion require approximately $5,000 and would probably take from eight to ten
                months to complete.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the work of the Clinic must be continued and expanded, both for
                humanitarian reasons and for the added light it will throw on our problems. I have
                mentioned the new rooms that we have very recently added to our Clinic. To make the
                proper use of this new space we shall need two more nurses, four more doctors, and
                one more secretary. Our present operating costs and our costs as they would be with
                the expanded staff are as follows: </p>

            <p>* Contraceptive materials are sold to patients who can afford them at cost. In many
                instances the patients cannot afford them and we give them to them. Some patients
                are able to pay a nominal charge for medical service, and the figure of $500. a
                month represents the approximate cost of contraceptives <emph rend="underline"
                    >less</emph> the amounts received from patients in payment thereof and in
                payment for medical services.</p>
            <p>Thus we shall have to add approximately $16,000. more to our annual budget in order
                to finance the expansion of our facilities. This expension is absolutely necessary
                unless we are to turn away daily an ever-increasing number of crushed and tragic
                figures who come to us for the knowledge that is life to them. But, as I have said,
                the growth of the Clinic is equally significant from the point of view of continued
                and broadening research, and as it grows and develops two additional things happen:
                (1) it becomes ever more important as a model for the organization of other Clinics
                in other localities, and (2) more and more it attracts the interest and affects the
                opinion of the medical profession. The Clinic has become increasingly a centre to
                which physicians from this country and Europe are coming for observation and for
                instruction in modern contraceptive technique, in which respect the Clinic is
                helping to supplement the teachings of the medical schools, which pay but scant, if
                any, attention to the problems of contraception. I do not think I exaggerate when I
                say that the Clinic is the greatest single stimulus in this country to the awakening
                of medical opinion and the greatest single source of contraceptive information for
                the profession. The influence and value of the Clinic along these lines is bound to
                grow as the Clinic grows and as it plays more and more a significant part in the
                community.</p>

            <p>The most immediately practical and fruitful steps in contraceptive research that I
                can think of are, as I have tried to show:</p>
            <p><del>1. In <emph rend="underline">laboratory</emph> research, the program of Dr. Crew
                    and his assistant, Dr. Weisner, at the <org>Edinburgh University</org>. This is
                    to cost $10,000 a year for three years. I wish to secure for them in this
                    country half of that amount, or $5,000 a year for three years.</del></p>
            <p>1. In <emph rend="underline">fact-finding</emph> research, the correlation and
                analysis of the more than 10,000 personal record charts of the Clinical Research
                Department of The American Birth Control League. This work, including publication of
                the results, would cost approximately $5,000 and could be completed, I believe, in
                eight to ten months.</p>
            <p>2. In <emph rend="underline">general</emph> research (combining elements of both
                laboratory and factual research) the program of the Clinic -- which, in addition to
                its value as an organ of research, ministers daily to the needs of suffering and
                ignorant mothers and also acts as an enormous stimulus in the spread of the Birth
                Control movement. I have shown that the Clinic’s program of increased usefulness
                will require, over and above its present budget, some $16,000 a year, the funds for
                which are not yet in sight.</p>
            <p>Believing as I do that hap-hazard, uncontrolled parentage leads directly and
                inevitably to poverty, overcrowding, delinquency, defectiveness, child labor, infant
                mortality, international friction and war, and believing further that the
                development of more perfect contraceptive methods and the better understanding of
                the various problems of Birth Control are necessary if these evils are to be stamped
                out, I hope that the program I have outlined in the foregoing pages may be carried
                out, and that the funds necessary thereto may be furnished. I shall only be too glad
                to give further details with respect to any of the matters discussed above, and I
                wish also to add that at any time desired the Clinical Research Department of the
                American Birth Control League can be separately incorporated, so as to dissociate it
                as a legal entity from the League. I refer to this because of the possibility that a
                donor who was primarily interested in research or medical work might prefer to give
                to a legal entity whose activities were restricted within these limits.</p>
