        <head>RADIO ADDRESS BY MARGARET SANGER</head>
        <head type="sub"><org reg="WRVA (Richmond)">STATION W R V A</org><lb/><place
                reg="Richmond, VA">RICHMOND VIRGINIA</place><lb/>7 P.M., <dateline><date

        <p> The greatest legal victory on the birth control movement was won last month when the
                <org>United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</org> unanimously
            upheld a decision of the lower courts liberating the medical profession, hospitals, and
            other health agencies from the legal restrictions of the Comstock laws.</p>
        <p>Until 1873, there were no obscenity laws in the <place>United States</place>. It is
            inspiring to think back on the principles that governed the founding fathers and to
            realize that true Americanism, as shown in the <title type="article"
                >Constitution</title> and the amendments to the Constitution, stood for freedom of
            speech and freedom of the mails.</p>
        <p>In 1873, Congress passed the so-called <name type="law"
                reg="United States Penal Code, Section 211">obscenity laws</name>, prohibiting the
            use of the mails and common carriers for various items which were considered lewd and
            obscene. Whatever our feeling about the aim of this legislation, we all agree that the
            inclusion of the phrase, “<q who="USC">articles and literature for the prevention of
                conception</q>,” was unfortunate. We must remember that this phrase meant something
            far different sixty years ago than it means today.</p>
        <p> The birth control movement has centered largely around rectifying this mistake. Birth
            control, as we understand it today, means family planning; it means the spacing of
            children so that each child may be born to a mother physically and mentally able to give
            it the care it needs; it means that every child should be planned for and wanted.</p>
        <p> The <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org>, of which I
            am the president has been seeking for seven years to have this law amended. We have
            believed that the medical profession should be free to give birth control advice when
            needed and that it should be exempted from the restrictions of the Comstock law. Public
            opinion in support of our belief has increased steadilly. Our organization numbers more
            than 100,000 individual endorsers and approximately 1,000 organizations have gone on
            record approving and supporting our aims.</p>
        <p> Early in December the <org>American Institute of Public Opinion</org> published the
            results of a poll on the question: “Should the distribution of information on birth
            control be made legal?” A cross section of the country gave an emphatic answer in the
            affirmative. A second poll was taken on the question: “What is the ideal size of a
            family?” The largest vote was given to the two and three-child family. America has
            accepted the idea of family planning. It knows that parenthood can be a matter of
            conscious decision and that children should come only to homes able and eager to take
            care of them.</p>
        <p> The decision of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals was handed down in a test
            case on the importation of birth control material, sent to a doctor for scientific
            purposes. It has given to America what we have been seeking through an amendment to the
            Comstock laws.</p>
        <p> Birth control--that is, advice given by physicians--is legal today. This Court decision
            brings to an end the sixty-three year reign of muddle and tyranny. After 60 years of
            confusion, during which information that is often needed to save health and lives of
            women was classed with obscenity, the rights of the American physician in the legitimate
            use of scientific birth control are clarified.</p>
        <p> “<q who="USCCA">We are satisfied</q>,” said the judges, “<q who="USCCA">that this
                statute embraced only such articles Congress would have denounced as immoral if it
                had understood all the conditions under which they were to be used. Its design, in
                our opinion, was not to prevent the importation, sale, or carriage by mail of things
                which might intelligently be employed by conscientious and competent physicians for
                the purpose of saving life or promoting the well-being of their patients.</q>”</p>
        <p> This means that the program for birth control can be widened--that a new epoch in the
            movement is beginning. Birth Control can now be made available through hospitals,
            doctors and health services. Women in small rural communities and on isolated farms, who
            are pleading for cheap and effective means of controlling the size of their families,
            can now be given help.</p>
        <p>The <org>Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</org> in <place reg="New York, NY">New
                York</place> has given birth control advice to 56 thousand patients during the
            fourteen years of its existence. It is the oldest birth control clinic in America and
            the largest in the world, and it stands ready to help physicians and health agencies
            throughout the country to establish birth control service. Our vast experience at this
            clinic has given us exact knowledge of what birth control can do, in bettering the
            condition of women. We know that the methods advised are effective, that they can be
            used by women of all classes. We know that women are eager and willing to use reliable
            birth control advice, so that they can have properly spaced, well planned families.</p>
        <p> In addition to maintaining a staff of physicians to care for those who ask for advice,
            we receive each year thousands of letters from women all over the country. These women,
            when it is possible, are referred to clinics and doctors. But all too often no help is
            near, and the very women who most need instruction cannot get it.</p>
        <p> I will read you one of the letters: “<q who="UNK">What is birth control? I have four
                children now and almost killed myself getting rid of the fifth. My husband never has
                steady work and we have a hard time to raise and feed the children. For <name
                    type="deity">God</name>’s sake tell me what to do! I’m sick and frantic with
                worry. This is my last and only hope. I’ll pray night and day until I hear from you.
                Please don’t fail me.</q>”</p>
        <p> It is because of women such as this one that I rejoice to tell you that birth control is
            legal. It is to help her and many thousands like her, that we now embark on a wider
            birth control program.</p>
