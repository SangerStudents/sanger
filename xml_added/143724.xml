            announcement: "Maragret Sanger, leader of the national and
            international birth control movement will speak on the subject, "Is
            Birth Control Legal?" Mrs. Sanger has devoted more than 20 years to
            the cause of birth control. Her devotion and vision have been
            crowned with success, and today birth control is recognized by
            physicians, scientists, and public-spirit citizens as a necessary
            part of preventative medicine and public health. Mrs. Sanger:-"</p>

        <head>RADIO ADDRESS BY MARGARET SANGER</head>
        <head type="sub">STATION W R V A<lb/>RICHMOND VIRGINIA<lb/>7 P.M.,
                <dateline><date value="1937-01-11">Monday, January 11, 1937</date></dateline></head>
        <p> The greatest legal victory on the birth control movement was won
            last month when the <org>United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
                the Second Circuit</org> unanimously upheld a decision of the
            lower courts liberating the medical profession, hospitals, and other
            health agencies from the legal restrictions of the Comstock
            laws.</p>
        <p>Until 1873, there were no obscenity laws in the <place>United
                States</place>. It is inspiring to think back on the principles
            that governed the founding fathers and to realize that true
            Americanism, as shown in the <title>Constitution</title> and the
            amendments to the Constitution, stood for freedom of speech and
            freedom of the mails.</p>
        <p>In 1873, Congress passed the so-called <name reg="Comstock Law"
                type="name">obscenity laws</name>, prohibiting the use of the
            mails and common carriers for various items which were considered
            lewd and obscene. Whatever our feeling about the aim of this
            legislation, we all agree that the inclusion of the phrase, “<q
                who="USC">articles and literature for the prevention of
                conception</q>,” was unfortunate. We must remember that this
            phrase meant something far different sixty years ago than it means
            today.</p>
        <p> The birth control movement has centered largely around rectifying
            this mistake. Birth control, as we understand it today, means family
            planning; it means the spacing of children so that each child may be
            born to a mother physically and mentally able to give it the care it
            needs; it means that every child should be planned for and
            wanted.</p>
        <p> The <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
                Control</org>, of which I am the president has been seeking for
            seven years to have this law amended. We have believed that the
            medical profession should be free to give birth control advice when
            needed and that it should be exempted from the restrictions of the
            Comstock law. Public opinion in support of our belief has increased
            steadilly. Our organization numbers more than 100,000 individual
            endorsers and approximately 1,000 organizations have gone on record
            approving and supporting our aims.</p>
        <p> Early in December the <org>American Institute of Public
                Opinion</org> published the results of a poll on the question:
            “Should the distribution of information on birth control be made
            legal?” A cross section of the country gave an emphatic answer in
            the affirmative. A second poll was taken on the question: “What is
            the ideal size of a family?” The largest vote was given to the two
            and three-child family. America has accepted the idea of family
            planning. It knows that parenthood can be a matter of conscious
            decision and that children should come only to homes able and eager
            to take care of them.</p>
        <p> The decision of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals was
            handed down in a test case on the importation of birth control
            material, sent to a doctor for scientific purposes. It has given to
            America what we have been seeking through an amendment to the
            Comstock laws.</p>
        <p> Birth control--that is, advice given by physicians--is legal today.
            This Court decision brings to an end the sixty-three year reign of
            muddle and tyranny. After 60 years of confusion, during which
            information that is often needed to save health and lives of women
            was classed with obscenity, the rights of the American physician in
            the legitimate use of scientific birth control are clarified.</p>
        <p> “<q who="USCCA">We are satisfied</q>,” said the judges, “<q
                who="USCCA">that this statute embraced only such articles
                Congress would have denounced as immoral if it had understood
                all the conditions under which they were to be used. Its design,
                in our opinion, was not to prevent the importation, sale, or
                carriage by mail of things which might intelligently be employed
                by conscientious and competent physicians for the purpose of
                saving life or promoting the well-being of their
            patients.</q>”</p>
        <p> This means that the program for birth control can be widened--that a
            new epoch in the movement is beginning. Birth Control can now be
            made available through hospitals, doctors and health services. Women
            in small rural communities and on isolated farms, who are pleading
            for cheap and effective means of controlling the size of their
            families, can now be given help.</p>
        <p>The <org>Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</org> in <place
                reg="New York, NY">New York</place> has given birth control
            advice to 56 thousand patients during the fourteen years of its
            existence. It is the oldest birth control clinic in America and the
            largest in the world, and it stands ready to help physicians and
            health agencies throughout the country to establish birth control
            service. Our vast experience at this clinic has given us exact
            knowledge of what birth control can do, in bettering the condition
            of women. We know that the methods advised are effective, that they
            can be used by women of all classes. We know that women are eager
            and willing to use reliable birth control advice, so that they can
            have properly spaced, well planned families.</p>
        <p> In addition to maintaining a staff of physicians to care for those
            who ask for advice, we receive each year thousands of letters from
            women all over the country. These women, when it is possible, are
            referred to clinics and doctors. But all too often no help is near,
            and the very women who most need instruction cannot get it.</p>
        <p> I will read you one of the letters: “<q who="UNK">What is birth
                control? I have four children now and almost killed myself
                getting rid of the fifth. My husband never has steady work and
                we have a hard time to raise and feed the children. For <name
                    type="deity">God</name>'s sake tell me what to do! I’m sick
                and frantic with worry. This is my last and only hope. I’ll pray
                night and day until I hear from you. Please don't fail
            me.</q>”</p>
        <p> It is because of women such as this one that I rejoice to tell you
            that birth control is legal. It is to help her and many thousands
            like her, that we now embark on a wider birth control program.</p>
