        <p>With the many and various organizations in existence today, for the
            direct purpose of getting women of all ages and classes into war
            activities, it does not seem necessary for me to dwell upon these
            activities. The <org reg="Women's  Auxillary Army Corps"
            >WAACS</org>, <org
                reg="Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service"
            >WAVES</org>, etc, etc, are doing the job of settling at least part
            of the question as to women in this war. Perhaps never before in our
            history have women been on a more equal footing with men as to
            training and ability then today. There are, however, two aspects of
            this war that need special consideration.</p>
        <p>The first is the importance of giving the girl of lesser education,
            elementary or grade school, a full year's training in essentials of
            greater and more precise details than those now given the Nurses’
            Aides. The year should be divided into four periods of three months
            each. The first three months to be spent in acquiring knowledge
            concerning the physical body and its environment. By this I mean any
            physical body--her own or others--and its proper environment, which
            includes cleanliness, posture, exercise, rest and order, freedom
            from vermin and insects; general body and environmental hygiene. The
            second three months should be given over to the study of food--its
            values, selection, preparation, special needs for herself and
            family, and costs. The third period should be devoted to training in
            the care of and obtaining information regarding infants from birth
            to the fifth year; the period where our infant deathrate is highest.
            And the last period to be a giving back, in service, to hospitals as
            nurses’ assistants. A certificate should be given each girl at the
            end of this training, and she should be paid each month a stipulated
            wage, just as the boys in the <org reg="Civilian Conservation Corps"
                >C. C. C.</org> Camps were paid while they were being
            instructed.</p>
        <p>This one years training should be given to girls from 16 to 18 years
            of age, and they should not be permitted to work nor encouraged to
            marry until the course is finished. Such training and knowledge
            would bring dividends not only to the girls themselves, but also
            their families, and to the future world in which they must live,
            marry, and bring up another generation.</p>
        <p>The second task that women, especially wives and mothers, should get
            themselves to do is to study and anticipate the kind of man who is
            to return to them after this war. I predict a different man--a
            different human being, as we look at the men in battle in the
                <place>Pacific</place>--one whose nerves may be shattered, whose
            outlook on and attitudes toward life may be shaken, cynical, perhaps
            bitter and disillusioned. What are we doing to prepare ourselves to
            know this man, to understand this boy whom we sent over to a war for
            which he was never trained, a war he did not desire? Doctors are
            reporting the lack in medical psychiatric training to deal with the
            conditions now manifesting themselves in our men which is called war
            neurosis. Women should be given courses of study through the
                <org>Red Cross</org>, or other agencies, in understanding and
            treating these men when they return to their cities, homes, and
            families. It will not be broken homes or maimed bodies that will
            need our care but rather the knowledge of what they have gone
            through in nervous and emotional stress and strain. Many of them are
            not going to be able temporarily to fit into the life they left
            without this understanding, therefore it is essential that we have
            some knowledge of what is recently called “psychosomatic” medicine.
            Our men have been and now are going through emotional hell, a kind
            of life unparalleled in our history and we as women--wives and
            mothers--should set ourselves the task of learning how to meet the
            situation and help them adjust to the life that awaits them. It will
            not be doctors or drugs that can meet this need; it will be courage,
            vision, gentleness, patients, knowledge, and understanding on the
            part of women. The need will be great, the task is ours now.</p>
