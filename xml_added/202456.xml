        <head>Foreword</head>
        <p>It is with deep satisfaction that I write this Foreword to the Proceedings of the <org
                reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 3rd">International
                Planned Parenthood Conference</org> held in <place>Bombay, India</place>, November
            24--29, 1952.</p>
        <p>The high quality of the papers and the discussion represent the thinking and experience
            of men and women experts in their particular fields. Their contributions helped to make
            the Conference as outstanding as it has been. The papers contributed the most recent
            scientific knowledge known in the field of population, contraception, infertility,
            abortion, sterilization, sex education and marriage counseling. These
                <title type="book">Proceedings</title> will furnish to scientific groups the world over an
            excellent reference book. I trust also that this will be an impetus to stimulate further
            study and research in all these areas.</p>
        <p>It was sixteen years ago that I made my first visit to <place>India</place> at the
            invitation of the <org>All India Womenâ€™s Conference</org> in <place
                reg="Travancore, India">Travancore</place>. The Conference passed a resolution
            demanding that contraceptive information be give to all women in India by the municipal
            health departments. This resolution was a firm declaration of faith and vision on the
            part of the women of India which I was convinced would produce results as soon as the
            political situation was settled and India became independent.</p>
        <p>That vision has expressed itself to-day in the enthusiasm and fine work of the
                <org>Family Planning Association of India</org>. Theirs will be a great struggle, to
            help millions of illiterate, hungry, poverty stricken masses to limit, plan and space
            their families. But just as they have struggled and fought, every one of them, for their
            independence, so do I believe that the idea of family planning will eventually be
            brought to every adult man and woman in India--that here too a victory will be won. </p>
