        <p>One hundred and one of the men and women who have worked hardest, longest and most
            fearlessly for the wiping out of social and industrial evils are defined and dealt with
            by the <org reg="Industrial Workers of the World">I. W. W.</org>, are on trial in <place
                reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</place>. The charge is conspiracy to obstruct the conduct
            of the war and 10,000 crimes are alleged against those now under prosecution. The
            charges, however, are being overshadowed by the great outstanding fact that the I. W.
            W., as an organization, is on trial for its life. <place reg="United States of America"
                >America</place> may be said to be divided into two camps--those who believe that
            such organizations as the I. W. W. have a right to exist and those who believe that the
            members of such organizations should be hunted down, jailed or lynched as menaces to
            society. </p>
        <p>This fact alone makes it imperative for the welfare of society that the full truth about
            the I. W. W. be known. Any issue sufficiently keen and clear-cut as to divide the
            country into two sharply defined camps brings with it a demand that, for the benefit of
            society, the fullest possible light be shed upon the facts in the case. Society, jealous
            of its own well-being, must see that the facts are known, in order that it may determine
            its future course. </p>
        <p>Besides this consideration, the fate of the persons on trial is of little significance.</p>
        <p>The trial of the I. W. W., however, takes on even a more compelling significance, when it
            is remembered that the evils with which that body deals in its own particular way are
            the same ones of which newspapers are constantly complaining, the same ones that occupy
            the greater part of the time of the courts, of congress, of legislatures and federal
            commissions, the same ones that claim chief attention of reformers, revolutionists,
            churches, economists, social settlements, and the great army of uplift agencies, to say
            nothing of labor organizations of every kind and description. The trial goes to the very
            heart of the things which are occupying the social consciousness--the things of which
            society at large talks and thinks all the time. </p>
        <p>Moreover, the I. W. W. is a distinctly American institution. It grew out of American
            soil, is the product of American conditions, deals with American problems. It is not an
            importation--it grew here. The problems with which it deals, its ideals and its methods
            are American. Until the problems are settled or conditions change, there will always be
            an I. W. W. or its equivalent. </p>
        <p>So far as society is concerned--and society is the chief party to the I. W. W. trial--the
            demand rises clear, strong and unavoidable: "<q who="UNK">Let's have the truth</q>."</p>
        <p>The case itself gives the best available opportunity to get at the truth. The
            government's prosecutors and its army of detectives, backed by that great mass of
            employers, who hate the I. W. W., will present one side of the case. That much society
            at large can be assured of but a trial is a legal battle and the prosecution does not
            concern itself with bring out facts that might hurt its own side of the case; that is
            left for the accused to do. For every apparently sound fact brought out by the
            prosecution, there must, if the truth is to be known, be brought out another fact by the
            accused. It costs great sums of money to get at those facts--it means the employment of
            investigators and the bringing of witnesses from great distances, it means months of
            work for lawyers even before the case comes to trial.</p>
        <p>The cost of the I. W. W. trial will be at least $100,000. This sum will not meet all the
            needs of the case, but it will assure the public of getting at most of the truth.
            Whether you agree with the I. W. W. or not, you cannot escape the conviction, if you
            know even so much of the truth as has thus far seeped through, that these men have given
            up home, comfort and necessities--have risked liberty and life itself to bring an end to
            those evils which society itself is constantly struggling to eradicate. The membership
            of the organization has raised $50,000 for the defense; the other $50,000 must come from
            socially conscious persons who have a passionate devotion to truth.</p>
        <p>Realizing this situation and its vast importance to society at large, a group of widely
            known liberals have formed a committee which is raising the second $50,000. <person
