        <head>Margaret Sanger to the Readers of The Review</head>
        <p>Once in a while we should look at our work from a distance, with a
            clear and impersonal vision, to try to see ourselves as others see
            us. Wherever I have gone, even in the most remote places, such as
                <place>Ceylon</place>, <place reg="Kandy, Ceylon">Kandy</place>,
                <place reg="Aden, Yemen">Aden</place>, <place
                reg="Alexandria, Egypt">Alexandria</place> and <place
                reg="Cairo, Egypt">Cairo</place>, I have found in bookshops
            where foreign literature is sold, that people come requesting
            literature on this subject, asking particularly for some literature
            from <place reg="United States of America">America</place>. It was
            also a keen pleasure to find so many people had first heard of Birth
            Control and "<q who="UNK">learned more about it</q>" from buying a
            magazine on Broadway from our faithful coworkers. One very shy
            little English stewardess who was working on a small boat coming
            from <place>Hong Kong</place> said to me, in a conversation during
            which we discussed large families and the cost of living, that she
            had once seen a "<q who="UNK">paper</q>" being sold in the streets
            of <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> "<q who="UNK">telling
                all about that</q>," and she had regretted ever since that she
            hadn't the courage to go up and get one–-wouldn't I see if I could
            get one for her when I got back. She had three children and "<q
                who="UNK">quite enough too</q>." Indeed it has been my happy
            experience during this trip around the world to find out for myself
            that even at the other end of the earth the American Birth Control
            Movement stands out upon our national horizon as the most vital
            social movement on this continent.</p>
        <p>It was not without a certain fear and reluctance that I set out for
            the Orient eight months ago. Our movement in this country was
            entering a dangerous and crucial period. Could it survive the
            attacks and the risks following our <title
                reg="First American Birth Control Conference">first Birth
                Control Conference</title> and the breaking up of the Town Hall
            meeting? In addition there was confronting us the gigantic task of
            organizing the <org reg="American Birth Control League">Birth
                Control League</org>, and raising funds to carry it forward.
            Nevertheless, convinced that if we could extend our sphere of
            influence to <place>Japan</place> and <place>China</place>, if we
            could in short "<soCalled>girdle the globe</soCalled>," our American
            movement would thereby be incalculably benefitted, I set forth.</p>
        <p>In view of these fears, the splendid work accomplished during my
            absence is therefore all the more gratifying. Due to the unceasing
            and energetic endeavors of my co-workers, <title>the BIRTH CONTROL
                REVIEW</title> has doubled its circulation. Our organizers are
            busily planning three State conferences for the near future-–in
                <place>Michigan</place>, <place>Ohio</place> and
                <place>Indiana</place>. A strong, live list of new members of
            the League is constantly growing. During my absence of eight months,
            the American Birth Control movement has proved that it is a live,
            healthy, growing organism, daily gaining in strength and widening
            its influence. These results are all the more remarkable in view of
            the deplorable apathy and bland indifference to this greatest of all
            contemporary problems exhibited by our politicians and the official
            representatives of our American civilization. By contrast, the
            intense and intelligent interest evidenced by the finest minds both
            of the Orient and the <place>Occident</place> acts as an
            inexhaustible source of courage and dynamic power. Fighting with us,
            in every country of the world, are the bravest and most courageous
            and far-seeing intellects of this age.</p>
        <p>To realize this triumph, to point to the concrete irrefutable
            evidence that this is a fact, one may turn to the remarkable edition
            of the <title rend="italics">Manchester Guardian Commercial</title>
            of August 17, in which, under the brilliant editorship of
                <person>John Maynard Keynes</person>, the problems of population
            and Birth Control are discussed by such prominent authorities as Mr.
            Keynes himself Signor <person>Benedetto Croce</person>, the most
            powerful and influential intellect of contemporary
                <place>Italy</place>), <person>Guglielmo Ferrero</person>, the
            eminent historian , Baron <person>Keikichi Ishimoto</person> of
                <place reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokio</place>, Professor
                <person>Alfred Franzis Pribram</person> of the <org>University
                of <place>Vienna</place></org>, and a number of other
            distinguished students of these problems. Both the Baron Ishimoto, a
            representative of Japanese thought, and John Maynard Keynes are in
            agreement concerning the world importance of the problem of Birth
            Control. "<q who="ISHKE">Birth Control is now the most important
                question of the world</q>," writes Baron Ishimoto. "<q
                who="ISHKE">In <place>England</place>, America,
                    <place>France</place>, and <place>Germany</place> the stage
                of argument is already past, and these countries are now
                entering on the stage of practice</q>." Speaking of the
            population problem of Japan, this authority asserts that "<q
                who="ISHKE">there is no other adequate remedy. It is most
                important for the people of Japan to make a serious and careful
                study of the question</q>."</p>
        <p>John Maynard Keynes concludes a striking analysis of the population
            problem from the point of view of the economists with the
            challenging declaration that this "<q who="KEYJO">is not merely an
                economist's problem, but in the near future the greatest of all
                political questions.</q>" "<q who="KEYJO">It will be a
                question</q>," this brilliant thinker goes on, "<q who="KEYJO"
                >which will arouse some of the deepest instincts and emotions of
                men, and feelings may run as passionately as in some of the
                earlier struggles between religions... When the instability of
                modern Society forces the issue, a great transition will have
                begun, with the endeavor by civilized man to assume conscious
                control in his own hands away from the blind instinct of mere
                predominant survival</q>."</p>
        <p>Let us never forget that what is called the Problem of Population is
            always, in the final analysis, the problem of Birth Control. Birth
            Control, we advocate as the only feasible, intelligent and practical
            solution to population problems. The latter problem is not merely
            the question of over-population, or underpopulation. Essentially
            this problem is not of the too-many or the too-few. It is a problem
            of <emph rend="italics">quality</emph> rather than of <emph
                rend="italics">quantity</emph>. Our concern is not so much with
            the mere number of men, women and children in this world, but with
            the creation of a healthy and efficient race. If we can, through
            Birth Control, develop all the latent powers of the coming
            generations, we may rest assured that they will more readily solve
            problems of adjustment and adaptation. We are indomitably convinced,
            in brief, that if we apply our fullest powers of intelligence,
            enlightenment and keen-sighted vision to the task of the creation of
            the next generation, we shall, in the long run, do more to bring
            order, sweetness and light out of the present social and sexual
            chaos than by complacently relying upon sentiment or tradition.</p>
        <p>In conclusion: it is with renewed and rejuvenated enthusiasm and
            increased vitality that we take up again our work in America,
            encouraged and grateful to our loyal and energetic co-workers who
            have so courageously "<soCalled>carried on</soCalled>" in our long
            absence.</p>
