        <p>Meaning life has To pass on to others what you have learned to be true, good &amp;
            useful, to dig down into the depths of reality for truth.</p>
        <p> Religion, in the sense of Church is necessary for certain people &amp; they are welcome
            to its consolation. For me, I have created my own religion or philosophy by which I
            “live &amp; move &amp; have my being?.”</p>
        <p> What keeps me going? Having an objective, good health, interest in my work, faith in the
            truth of my objective.</p>
        <p> What are the sources of your inspirations. The abject misery of ignorance in human
            beings.</p>
        <p> What is the goal or motive force of your toil. To definitely establish certain
            structures of society which shall uphold such truths as Science &amp; research may
            discover.</p>
        <p> Where do you find consolation &amp; your happiness. In seeing the results <del>of
                your</del> in happier lives, <del>and</del> in hearing others <del>
                <unclear>claim for their own</unclear>
            </del>? <add rend="handwritten">voice</add>, ideas that you <del>passed on</del> created
            &amp; passed on. Where your treasure lies. </p>
