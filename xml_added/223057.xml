        <p>If people are going to be immoral or promiscuous in their sex relations then at least let
            them protect Society &amp; the Race from disease &amp; offspring.</p>
        <p>To my way of thinking the moral question is not effected by contraceptives.</p>
        <p>Morality begins within one. Nothing outside can make any woman immoral.</p>
        <p>If the Churches must keep her in ignorance to keep her pure &amp; moral then they have
            failed in their work &amp; had better give the job over to Science &amp; be done with
            it.</p>
