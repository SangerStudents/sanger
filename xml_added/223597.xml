        <head>BIRTH CONTROL AND WOMAN'S HEALTH</head>
        <byline>By Margaret Sanger</byline>
        <div>
            <p>One of the first questions asked by women desirous of
                contraceptive information, is: "<q who="UNK">Will the knowledge
                    of birth control, when put into practice, injure the health
                    of either the man or the woman?</q>"</p>
            <p>The conclusion arrived at by some of the most prominent
                authorities on the subject is to the effect that there are safe
                and reliable means of controlling birth which will not injure
                the health of either the man or the woman.</p>
            <p>Among these eminent authorities may be included such men as Dr.
                    <person reg="Ellis, Havelock">Havelock Ellis</person>, Dr.
                    <person reg="Treub, Hector">Hector Treub</person>, Professor
                    <person reg="Forel, Auguste">Forel</person>, Dr. <person
                    reg="Bloch, Iwan">Iwan Bloch</person>, Dr. <person
                    reg="Nystrom, Anton">Anton Nystrom</person>, Dr. <person
                    reg="Jacobi, Abraham">A. Jacoby</person>, formerly President
                of the<org> American Medical Association</org>, and Dr. <person
                    reg="Robinson, William J.">William J. Robinson</person>,
                who, in his book on the "<title>Limitation of Offspring</title>"
                challenges any physician or gynecologist to produce "<q
                    who="ROBWI">a single case</q>," in which disease or injury
                resulted from modern methods of birth control.</p>
            <p>Not only are we fortunate in possessing the opinions of the best
                known medical authorities, but we are also fortunate in
                possessing historical facts collected in <place
                    reg="Netherlands, the">Holland</place> and <place>New
                    Zealand</place>, where for years the knowledge of birth
                control has been disseminated among the working class women. </p>
            <p>In these two countries we find the women largely free from
                so-called "<soCalled>female complaints</soCalled>" common to the
                women of the <place reg="United States of America">United
                    States</place>. There are two practical reasons for this.
                The first one is the fact that women go to the birth control
                clinic for instruction and information, thus giving the nurse
                the opportunity to detect any ailment of incipient disease,
                which, if present, is promptly treated by a specialist. The
                second reason is, that owing to scientific knowledge of birth
                control, women are saved from the deteriorating and ghastly
                effects of abortion, which so many women of the United States
                frequently undergo.</p>
            <p>Military statistics of Holland prove that the average stature of
                the male citizens has increased by four inches during the thirty
                years since the first birth control clinic was opened in <place
                    reg="Amsterdam, the Netherlands">Amsterdam</place>.</p>
            <p>We also learn from statistics in Holland for 1912 that the death
                rate in Amsterdam, which, in 1881, was 25.1, had fallen in 1912
                to 11.2, the lowest death rate reported of all lists submitted.
                The infant mortality, which in 1881 was 203, had fallen in 1912
                to 64. These statistics, together with numerous other reports,
                which for want of space cannot be related, prove conclusively
                that the scientific application of birth control among the
                working class has resulted in a racial improvement.</p>
            <p>In this country stupid and puritanical laws have been the cause
                of more than <emph rend="italics">fifty thousand</emph> annual
                deaths resulting from abortions. These laws have caused hundreds
                of thousands of women to drag out a futile existence due to
                nervous exhaustion from too frequent child-bearing. These laws
                are responsible for the birth of children tainted by syphilis,
                who become not only a charge upon the public, but also a
                detriment to the human race.</p>
            <p>I am going to quote from one of the many typical letters I am
                constantly receiving form all parts of the country, in order
                that my readers may get some idea of conditions as they exist
                among us. </p>

            <head type="sub">A Poignant Plea for Birth Control</head>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">I was left without a father when a girl of fourteen
                    years old. I was the oldest child of five. My mother had no
                    means of support except her two hands, so we worked at
                    anything we could, my job being nurse girl at home while
                    mother worked most of the time, as she could earn more money
                    than I could, for she could do harder work.</q></p>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">I wasn't very strong and finally after two years my
                    mother got so tired and worn out trying to make a living for
                    so many, she married again, and as she married a poor man,
                    we children were not much better off. At the age of
                    seventeen I married a man, a brakeman on the ----Railroad,
                    who was eleven years older than I. He drank some and was a
                    very frail looking man, but I was very ignorant of the world
                    and did not think of anything but making a home for myself
                    and husband. After eleven months I had a little girl born to
                    me. I did not want more children, but my mother-in-law told
                    me it was a terrible sin to do anything to keep from having
                    children and that the Lord only sent just thing, and if I
                    heard anything I was told it was injurious, so I did not
                    try.</q></p>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">In eleven months again, Oct. 25, I had another
                    little puny girl. In twenty-three months, Sept. 25, I had a
                    seven-lb. boy. In ten months, July 15, I had a seven-months
                    baby that lived five hours. In eleven months, June 20, I had
                    another little girl. In seventeen months, Nov. 30, another
                    boy. In nine months a four months' miscarriage. In twelve
                    month another girl, and in three and a half years another
                    girl.</q></p>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">All of these children were born into poverty; the
                    father's health was always poor, and when the third girl was
                    born he was discharged from the road because of his
                    disability, yet he was still able to put children into the
                    world. When the oldest child was twelve years old the father
                    died of concussion of the brain while the youngest child was
                    born two months after his death.</q></p>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">Now, Mrs. Sanger, I did not want those children,
                    because even in my ignorance I had sense enough to know that
                    I had no right to bring those children into such a world
                    where they could not have decent care, for I was not able to
                    do it myself nor hire it done. I prayed and I prayed that
                    they would die when they were born. Praying did no good and
                    today I have read and studied enough to know that I am the
                    mother of seven living children and that I committed a crime
                    by bringing them into the world, their father was syphilitic
                    (I did not know about such things when I was a girl). One
                    son is to be sent to <place>Mexico</place>, while one of my
                    girls is a victim of the white slave traffic</q>.</p>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">I raised my family in a little college town in ----
                    and am well known there, for I made my living washing and
                    working for the college people while I raised my little
                    brood. I often wondered why those educated well-to-do people
                    never had so many children. I have one married daughter who
                    is tubercular, and she also has two little girls, only a
                    year apart. I feel so bad about it, and write to ask you to
                    send me information for her. Don't stop your good work;
                    don't think it's not appreciated; for there are hundreds of
                    women like myself who are not afraid to risk their lives to
                    help you to get this information to poor women who need
                    it.</q>"</p>
            <p>This is but one illustration of what women endure through the
                ravages of syphilis. The waste from tuberculosis is no less
                terrible.</p>
            <p>Here is another letter which speaks for itself:</p>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">Kindly pardon me for writing this to you, not
                    knowing what trouble this may cause you. But I've heard of
                    you through a friend and realize you are a friend of
                    humanity. If people would see with your light, the world
                    would be healthy. I married the first time when I was
                    eighteen years old, a drinking man. I became mother to five
                    children. In 1908 my husband died of consumption. I lost two
                    of my oldest children from the same disease, one at 16 and
                    the other at 23. The youngest of them all, a sweet girl of
                    nineteen, now lies at ------sanatorium expecting to leave us
                    at any time. The other sister and brother look very
                    poorly.</q></p>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">I have always worked very hard, because I had to.
                    In 1913 I married again, a good man this time, but a
                    laboring man, and our constant fear and trouble is what may
                    happen if we bring children into the world. I'm forty-six
                    years old this month and not very well any more, either. So
                    a Godsend will be some one who can tell me how to care for
                    myself, so I can be free from suffering and also not bring
                    mortals to earth to suffer and die.</q>"</p>
            <p>Does the State ever ask itself is it economic to support and
                educate human beings up to the ages specified above, only to
                lose them in the end, knowing in advance that they should never
                have been born?</p>
            <p>The cases given are only two of thousands of good women whose
                lives have been spent uselessly bearing burdens that no
                civilized society should put upon them. These things are past
                and we cannot undo the harm that has been done to the victims,
                but we can prevent our younger generation from committing the
                same crimes. If you will compare the letter which follows with
                the early history of the first one quoted above, you will see a
                young life starting out which, if left in ignorance, will have
                the same disastrous experience:</p>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">Mine is a pitiful case. Having been married over a
                    year and having lost our baby (which was premature) I am now
                    going to have another. I am in wretched health. I have been
                    in bed for months since I married. The doctors all say that
                    motherhood is not for me, but only shake their heads when I
                    ask them for advice as how to keep from having children so
                    fast, at least until my health improves. I live in dread
                    that this one will be born dead, too, for my health is as
                    bad as before. The doctors are continually treating me, but
                    I never seem to improve.</q></p>
            <p>"<q who="UNK">My husband and I are also deeply in debt-- as you
                    know, doctors and nurses can eat up money-- and as matters
                    stand we will never be free from debt again unless something
                    is done. I want you to know that I am not selfish, for I
                    love children. But at twenty-one years I have developed into
                    a worn out, faded sickly woman, and I know that my husband
                    is in time bound to grow weary of the heavy yoke that is put
                    on his shoulders. We are doing all that we can to bring this
                    little baby into the world as healthy as my frail body will
                    permit, but after that (should I live) I would like to
                    refrain from having children until I get stronger.</q>"</p>
            <p>Could there be a more worthy case of the right of an individual
                to demand, yes, <emph rend="italics">demand</emph> of science,
                of the medical profession and of the State, the benefit of the
                knowledge society has accumulated on this subject?</p>
            <p>These three cases represent, in a small degree, living conditions
                as they are. What a waste of human life our ignorance and
                stupidity is costing us! What an amount of useless suffering
                will be avoided when women have birth control knowledge!</p>
            <p>We are dealing with peculiar facts today, so far as the health of
                the race is concerned. In the early history of the race,
                so-called "<soCalled>natural law</soCalled>" reigned
                undisturbed. Under its pitiless and unsympathetic iron rule,
                only the strongest, most courageous could live and become
                progenitors of the race. The weak died early, or were killed.
                Today, however, civilization has brought sympathy, pity,
                tenderness and other lofty and worthy sentiments, which
                interfere with the law of natural selection. We are now in a
                state where our charities, our compensation acts, our pensions,
                hospitals and even our drainage and sanitary equipment all tend
                to keep alive the sickly and weak, who are allowed to propagate
                and in turn produce a race of degenerates.</p>
            <p>What we need to do, is to combine Reason with this higher sense
                of sympathy, and to encourage the birth of those only whose
                inheritance is health, and so only so many as can be brought up
                in cleanliness and happiness. </p>
