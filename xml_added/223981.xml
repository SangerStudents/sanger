        <head>The Tragedy of the Accidental Child</head>
        <byline rend="italics">By Margaret Sanger</byline>
        <p>The first right of the child is to be wanted--to be desired with an
            intensity of love that gives it its title to being and joyful
            impulse to life. It should be wanted by both parents, but especially
            by the mother, who is to carry it, nourish it, and perhaps influence
            its life by her thoughts, her passions, her loves, her hates, her
            yearnings.</p>
        <p>We have observed how strongly children inherit their mother's traits.
                <person reg="Freud, Sigmund ">Freud</person> has told us of
            children so greatly influenced by their mothers as to be incapable
            of a mate love for anyone who does not resemble them. We are all
            familiar with the old wives' tales of children
                "<soCalled>marked</soCalled>" because of a mother's fright or
            other strong emotion, though we know little concerning the truth or
            falsity of this theory. Just as little do we know of the effect of
            fear, hate, yearning, or disgust in the mother at the time of
            conception.</p>
        <p>Until scientists give years of careful study to the problem there
            will be no accurate information concerning it. At most we can only
            speculate upon it now. But since the life of the mother in its other
            phases, seems to affect the child so vitally, is it not probably
            that strong emotion at the time of conception, emotion which lingers
            and preys upon the mind of the mother in the months following,
            leaves its impress deeply if not indelibly upon the life of the
            child? And is it not time that the scientists were making a direct
            and exhaustive study of a problem which may be fraught with so much
            of weal or woe for the race?</p>
        <p>My personal opinion, founded upon observation as nurse and as worker
            in the Birth Control movement, is that these emotions have a
            profound effect upon the child. I believe that the mother's fear of
            pregnancy has a most unhappy influence upon the life of her
            offspring. I believe that this fear and the unsuccessful practice of
            coitus interruptus are responsible for the timidity, the fretfulness
            and feebleness of many infants.</p>
        <p>Does it stand to reason that no child can be what it should be,
            physically, mentally or spiritually, if it is conceived and carried
            by a mother to whom the embraces of her husband are repugnant? Can a
            mother who begins the creation of the little life in disgust and in
            disgust brings it to birth, bequeath to her baby the strength, the
            mental vigor or the disposition to happiness that is its inherent
            right? Can a mother whose very being is trembling in terrified
            submission or quivering with hate at the time of conception and who
            for months thereafter experiences a measure of these same emotions,
            bring her child forth as well equipped for the life struggle as it
            would otherwise have been? We know something of the effect of worry
            upon the mother's milk. What may we not yet discover concerning the
            effect of worry or even stronger emotions upon her blood that for
            nine months flows through the very being of the child?</p>
        <p>Why the great numbers of feeble-minded children? Why the hosts of
            infants born too feeble to withstand the difficulties of the first
            year of existence? Why the weakling manhood and womanhood, too timid
            to make effective protest against the great social wrongs and
            tyrannies which crush them?</p>
        <p>Science has answered these questions in part, but only in part. I do
            not believe that they will be conclusively answered until account is
            taken of the condition of the mind of the mother from the moment of
            the creative embrace until the child is born.</p>
        <p>The tragedy of the unwanted child--of the accidental child-–only
            begins with whatever evil prenatal effect the emotional condition of
            the mother may have upon it. The right to be wanted is it first
            right but only the first of many that are ignored. Usually it
            suffers a further handicap by being carried by a mother who is
            physically ill or overworked. Fear of pregnancy is frequently
            inspired in the mind of the mother by the burden of too many
            children, or by want or by both. When it arrives, the accidental
            child usually finds itself in the ranks of the millions of hungry
            and neglected infants. Often it is merely a candidate for an item in
            the infant mortality statistics. We have before us always the
            horrible spectacle of hundreds of thousands of children dying
            miserably before they have lived twelve months, of other hundred of
            thousands dying just as miserably before they reach the age of five.
            Worse still, is the lot of those other millions who after the age of
            five take their places among the toilers in mills and factories.</p>
        <p>What have we to offer those who do not go to the places of toil? To
            the majority of them, dwelling places too cluttered and crowded to
            be called homes. Schools that are crowded, in which "half time" is
            the sop of the state to the needs of childhood. Streets, filthy and
            crowded, as their playgrounds. And for some of them, finally,
            crowded jails and crowded institutions for the feeble-minded.
            Crowded always, from the beginning to the end of their monotonous
            lives, the hordes of unwanted children seldom have a chance to
            forget their unwanted state.</p>
        <p>We hear a good deal of sentimentality about unfailing mother love. We
            are told that even these unwanted children have <emph rend="italics"
                >that</emph> to protect them in their hard lots. But how few of
            the poorer women have the time and the strength to let mother love
            develop and express itself? We make a mistake in assuming that
            mothers are always kind. We forget that under the stress of caring
            for many children, under the strain of helping to earn bread for
            hungry mouths and clothing for bodies clothed in rags, the strongest
            mother love may turn bitter and cruel.</p>
        <p>Is anything more horrible, more hopeless than the cruelty of a mother
            worried and tired to distraction? Oh, yes, there is much of it! If
            you doubt, go for a little while to live among the families whose
            mothers are over-burdened with children whose, bodies and brains are
            worn threadbare with toil inside and outside the home. Unfortunately
            it is not only the hardhearted father of the story book who is cruel
            to the children-–there is an appalling amount of cruelty from the
            mothers too.</p>
        <p>Which of us has not seen such cruelty, even in the streets? A case
            significant only because it is of frequent occurrence came to my
            attention a few months ago. A woman, evidently worn out by a day's
            work, was wheeling a child in a baby buggy in fourteenth street.
            Another child, about three years old, was trudging at her side,
            clinging heavily to her skirt. It had on badly shaped, cheap shoes,
            which probably hurt its feet. It cried monotonously as it walked.
            The mother, apparently in frantic haste to reach home and prepare
            supper, doubtless for a husband and several other children–-suddenly
            felt the drag of the weary, crying child. She struck it, first
            across one side of its little face and then the other. The tiny
            thing, surprised by the sudden attack, fell face downward upon the
            sidewalk. The furious, nerve-wracked mother, picked it up by the
            chin and struck it again and again on the back until a passer-by
            interfered. To a threat of arrest she retorted: "<q who="UNK">Oh,
                you shut up. This is my kid and I'll lick it when I want
            to.</q>"</p>
        <p>Do you hesitate to believe that this happens often? It is common–-as
            common, almost, as unwanted children. Of course, the mother later on
            rocks the child to sleep, covers its bruised face with kisses and
            seeks to wipe out the memory of the blows in a flood of remorse. But
            the scars are there, in the mind of the child, if not upon its body.
            Our militarists and ecclesiastics who shout for more and more
            children, who speak of them as "<soCalled>blessings</soCalled>,"
            shut their eyes tightly to this aspect of child life among the
            harassed poor.</p>
        <p>In <place>France</place>, where a knowledge of contraceptives is
            available to a large proportion of the working-class mothers,
            another typical scene is often witnessed. The mother arranges with
            her employer to leave her work for a time in order to fetch her
            child from school through the dangerous crossings and see it safely
            past the groups of older and rougher boys. Her attitude is almost
            invariably one of tenderness. The differences lies in the number of
            children. This French mother is not so badly overburdened and her
            child is the more precious to her because she has only the one, or
            two.</p>
        <p>The child's right to a different lot from that depicted here is no
            longer questioned by thinking people. Many men and women are now
            working to alleviate the burdens and sorrows of the army of unwanted
            infants. The material side of the child's life is bound to receive a
            certain amount of consideration now and in the future. Even the
            unwanted children are becoming fewer. And the medical profession,
            even the church, the imperialist, and the employer of
                "<soCalled>hands</soCalled>"-–all those who are in need of cheap
            and ignorant humanity-–will see to it that children have better
            shelter and get more of the food and clothing necessary to their
            existence. This they will do in the interest of their own
            institutions.</p>
        <p>Material rights of the child, however, are far more easy to enumerate
            and to obtain-–when children are scarce–-than are others of its
            rights which, for want of a better name, we may call spiritual. The
            awakening of the parents to these rights of the child, some of which
            have been indicated in the present article, must follow quickly upon
            the heels of its material rights.</p>
        <p>The eugenist very correctly contends that the parents should be in
            good health, mentally and physically, when the child is conceived.
            They do well to insist that it is the first material right of the
            child to be "<soCalled>well born</soCalled>." But have they taken
            into consideration all of the factors?</p>
        <p>From what deep spring of moral and spiritual weakness arises this
            huge stream of the cringing, the suppliant, the submissive? Whence
            come the natures of these millions of human beings who are but
            timorous pawns moved hither and thither upon the chess board of
            existence by a few powerful hands?</p>
        <p>Who can say that it is not because we come into life with the
            feeling, conscious or subconscious,<emph rend="italics"> that we are
                not wanted-–that we are accidents?</emph> Who can say that it is
            not because we have graven upon our natures, the fear, the disgust,
            the loathing, the shrinking of our mothers? Men and women who have
            lived through the past four years, in any country on the globe, know
            what it is to be pawns. Not all the power of the church, not all the
            teachings of Christianity, not all our education, our theories of
            right and wrong, availed the weak wills of the millions of
                "<soCalled>accidents</soCalled>," when a few tyrants plunged the
            civilized world into warfare.</p>
        <p>When we people the earth with men and women who are not
                "<soCalled>accidents</soCalled>," these human holocausts cannot
            occur. When we have men and women whose wills, whose moral and
            spiritual natures have not been marred by fear and hate from the
            moment of conception, war will be impossible.</p>
        <p>When we insist that conception be surrounded by its normal atmosphere
            of triumphant love and happiness, and thus infuse into the new life
            the spark of love, with its impulse to live, to love in its turn, to
            be strong, we shall have a new sort of humanity. There will be no
            more "<soCalled>dumb, driven cattle</soCalled>" in the guise of men.
            When we can visualize out of the surging love and happiness of the
            creative act the strong, healthy, happy, mentally and spiritually
            vigorous child, we shall produce individuals with intellectual and
            spiritual gifts beyond those of any race that has yet appeared upon
            earth.</p>
        <p>Our imaginations are as yet too weak, too uninformed, to portray to
            us the strength, the beauty and the wonder of a humanity yet to be
            brought into being-–through children created in the flame of
            love.</p>
