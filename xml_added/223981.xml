        <head>The Tragedy of the Accidental Child</head>
        <byline rend="italics">By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p>The first right of the child is to be wanted--to be desired with an intensity of love
            that gives it its title to being and joyful impulse to life. It should be wanted by both
            parents, but especially by the mother, who is to carry it, nourish it, and perhaps
            influence its life by her thoughts, her passions, her loves, her hates, her
            yearnings.</p>
        <p>We have observed how strongly children inherit their mother's traits. <person
                reg="Freud, Sigmund ">Freud</person> has told us of children so greatly influenced
            by their mothers as to be incapable of a mate love for anyone who does not resemble
            them. We are all familiar with the old wives' tales of children
                "marked" because of a mother's fright or other strong emotion,
            though we know little concerning the truth or falsity of this theory. Just as little do
            we know of the effect of fear, hate, yearning, or disgust in the mother at the time of
            conception.</p>
        <p>Until scientists give years of careful study to the problem there will be no accurate
            information concerning it. At most we can only speculate upon it now. But since the life
            of the mother in its other phases, seems to affect the child so vitally, is it not
            probably that strong emotion at the time of conception, emotion which lingers and preys
            upon the mind of the mother in the months following, leaves its impress deeply if not
            indelibly upon the life of the child? And is it not time that the scientists were making
            a direct and exhaustive study of a problem which may be fraught with so much of weal or
            woe for the race?</p>
        <p>My personal opinion, founded upon observation as nurse and as worker in the Birth Control
            movement, is that these emotions have a profound effect upon the child. I believe that
            the mother's fear of pregnancy has a most unhappy influence upon the life of her
            offspring. I believe that this fear and the unsuccessful practice of coitus interruptus
            are responsible for the timidity, the fretfulness and feebleness of many infants.</p>
        <p>Does it stand to reason that no child can be what it should be, physically, mentally or
            spiritually, if it is conceived and carried by a mother to whom the embraces of her
            husband are repugnant? Can a mother who begins the creation of the little life in
            disgust and in disgust brings it to birth, bequeath to her baby the strength, the mental
            vigor or the disposition to happiness that is its inherent right? Can a mother whose
            very being is trembling in terrified submission or quivering with hate at the time of
            conception and who for months thereafter experiences a measure of these same emotions,
            bring her child forth as well equipped for the life struggle as it would otherwise have
            been? We know something of the effect of worry upon the mother's milk. What may we not
            yet discover concerning the effect of worry or even stronger emotions upon her blood
            that for nine months flows through the very being of the child?</p>
        <p>Why the great numbers of feeble-minded children? Why the hosts of infants born too feeble
            to withstand the difficulties of the first year of existence? Why the weakling manhood
            and womanhood, too timid to make effective protest against the great social wrongs and
            tyrannies which crush them?</p>
        <p>Science has answered these questions in part, but only in part. I do not believe that
            they will be conclusively answered until account is taken of the condition of the mind
            of the mother from the moment of the creative embrace until the child is born.</p>
        <p>The tragedy of the unwanted child--of the accidental child-–only begins with whatever
            evil prenatal effect the emotional condition of the mother may have upon it. The right
            to be wanted is it first right but only the first of many that are ignored. Usually it
            suffers a further handicap by being carried by a mother who is physically ill or
            overworked. Fear of pregnancy is frequently inspired in the mind of the mother by the
            burden of too many children, or by want or by both. When it arrives, the accidental
            child usually finds itself in the ranks of the millions of hungry and neglected infants.
            Often it is merely a candidate for an item in the infant mortality statistics. We have
            before us always the horrible spectacle of hundreds of thousands of children dying
            miserably before they have lived twelve months, of other hundred of thousands dying just
            as miserably before they reach the age of five. Worse still, is the lot of those other
            millions who after the age of five take their places among the toilers in mills and
            factories.</p>
        <p>What have we to offer those who do not go to the places of toil? To the majority of them,
            dwelling places too cluttered and crowded to be called homes. Schools that are crowded,
            in which "half time" is the sop of the state to the needs of childhood. Streets, filthy
            and crowded, as their playgrounds. And for some of them, finally, crowded jails and
            crowded institutions for the feeble-minded. Crowded always, from the beginning to the
            end of their monotonous lives, the hordes of unwanted children seldom have a chance to
            forget their unwanted state.</p>
        <p>We hear a good deal of sentimentality about unfailing mother love. We are told that even
            these unwanted children have <emph rend="italics">that</emph> to protect them in their
            hard lots. But how few of the poorer women have the time and the strength to let mother
            love develop and express itself? We make a mistake in assuming that mothers are always
            kind. We forget that under the stress of caring for many children, under the strain of
            helping to earn bread for hungry mouths and clothing for bodies clothed in rags, the
            strongest mother love may turn bitter and cruel.</p>
        <p>Is anything more horrible, more hopeless than the cruelty of a mother worried and tired
            to distraction? Oh, yes, there is much of it! If you doubt, go for a little while to
            live among the families whose mothers are over-burdened with children whose, bodies and
            brains are worn threadbare with toil inside and outside the home. Unfortunately it is
            not only the hardhearted father of the story book who is cruel to the children-–there is
            an appalling amount of cruelty from the mothers too.</p>
        <p>Which of us has not seen such cruelty, even in the streets? A case significant only
            because it is of frequent occurrence came to my attention a few months ago. A woman,
            evidently worn out by a day's work, was wheeling a child in a baby buggy in fourteenth
            street. Another child, about three years old, was trudging at her side, clinging heavily
            to her skirt. It had on badly shaped, cheap shoes, which probably hurt its feet. It
            cried monotonously as it walked. The mother, apparently in frantic haste to reach home
            and prepare supper, doubtless for a husband and several other children–-suddenly felt
            the drag of the weary, crying child. She struck it, first across one side of its little
            face and then the other. The tiny thing, surprised by the sudden attack, fell face
            downward upon the sidewalk. The furious, nerve-wracked mother, picked it up by the chin
            and struck it again and again on the back until a passer-by interfered. To a threat of
            arrest she retorted: "<q who="UNK">Oh, you shut up. This is my kid and I'll lick it when
                I want to.</q>"</p>
        <p>Do you hesitate to believe that this happens often? It is common–-as common, almost, as
            unwanted children. Of course, the mother later on rocks the child to sleep, covers its
            bruised face with kisses and seeks to wipe out the memory of the blows in a flood of
            remorse. But the scars are there, in the mind of the child, if not upon its body. Our
            militarists and ecclesiastics who shout for more and more children, who speak of them as
                "blessings," shut their eyes tightly to this aspect of child
            life among the harassed poor.</p>
        <p>In <place>France</place>, where a knowledge of contraceptives is available to a large
            proportion of the working-class mothers, another typical scene is often witnessed. The
            mother arranges with her employer to leave her work for a time in order to fetch her
            child from school through the dangerous crossings and see it safely past the groups of
            older and rougher boys. Her attitude is almost invariably one of tenderness. The
            differences lies in the number of children. This French mother is not so badly
            overburdened and her child is the more precious to her because she has only the one, or
            two.</p>
        <p>The child's right to a different lot from that depicted here is no longer questioned by
            thinking people. Many men and women are now working to alleviate the burdens and sorrows
            of the army of unwanted infants. The material side of the child's life is bound to
            receive a certain amount of consideration now and in the future. Even the unwanted
            children are becoming fewer. And the medical profession, even the church, the
            imperialist, and the employer of "hands"-–all those who are in need
            of cheap and ignorant humanity-–will see to it that children have better shelter and get
            more of the food and clothing necessary to their existence. This they will do in the
            interest of their own institutions.</p>
        <p>Material rights of the child, however, are far more easy to enumerate and to obtain-–when
            children are scarce–-than are others of its rights which, for want of a better name, we
            may call spiritual. The awakening of the parents to these rights of the child, some of
            which have been indicated in the present article, must follow quickly upon the heels of
            its material rights.</p>
        <p>The eugenist very correctly contends that the parents should be in good health, mentally
            and physically, when the child is conceived. They do well to insist that it is the first
            material right of the child to be "well born." But have they taken
            into consideration all of the factors?</p>
        <p>From what deep spring of moral and spiritual weakness arises this huge stream of the
            cringing, the suppliant, the submissive? Whence come the natures of these millions of
            human beings who are but timorous pawns moved hither and thither upon the chess board of
            existence by a few powerful hands?</p>
        <p>Who can say that it is not because we come into life with the feeling, conscious or
                subconscious,<emph rend="italics"> that we are not wanted-–that we are
                accidents?</emph> Who can say that it is not because we have graven upon our
            natures, the fear, the disgust, the loathing, the shrinking of our mothers? Men and
            women who have lived through the past four years, in any country on the globe, know what
            it is to be pawns. Not all the power of the church, not all the teachings of
            Christianity, not all our education, our theories of right and wrong, availed the weak
            wills of the millions of "accidents," when a few tyrants plunged
            the civilized world into warfare.</p>
        <p>When we people the earth with men and women who are not "accidents,"
            these human holocausts cannot occur. When we have men and women whose wills, whose moral
            and spiritual natures have not been marred by fear and hate from the moment of
            conception, war will be impossible.</p>
        <p>When we insist that conception be surrounded by its normal atmosphere of triumphant love
            and happiness, and thus infuse into the new life the spark of love, with its impulse to
            live, to love in its turn, to be strong, we shall have a new sort of humanity. There
            will be no more "dumb, driven cattle" in the guise of men. When we
            can visualize out of the surging love and happiness of the creative act the strong,
            healthy, happy, mentally and spiritually vigorous child, we shall produce individuals
            with intellectual and spiritual gifts beyond those of any race that has yet appeared
            upon earth.</p>
        <p>Our imaginations are as yet too weak, too uninformed, to portray to us the strength, the
            beauty and the wonder of a humanity yet to be brought into being-–through children
            created in the flame of love.</p>
