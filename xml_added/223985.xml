        <p/>

        <p>On August 7th, 1937, a group of us* sailed from <place reg="Honolulu, HI"
                >Honolulu</place> on a contemplated trip to <place>China</place>. The resolution
            adopted by the <org>Chinese Medical Association</org> “<q who="CMA">that contraception
                is a part of the activities of public health, especially in the field of maternity
                and child welfare</q>,” the intensive educational campaigns carried on by the
                <org>New Life Movement</org>, the <org>Mass Education Movement</org>, and other
            organizations, and the cordial invitations from a number of Chinese public health
            officials to assist in the development of a practical birth control program, led me to
            make plans to return to China for the Fall months of this year.</p>
        <p>Despite peaceful seas, there was not "smooth sailing" in our minds, owing to the rumors
            of war and the possibility of a major conflict involving the whole of
                <place>Asia</place>, and perhaps the world. But, opposed to these fears was the
            faith, based on experience in the past, that the difficulty would be likely to blow
            over, and the Chinese “incident,” so-called by the Japanese, be of short duration. It
            was the general opinion that by the time of our arrival in China, peace negotiations
            would be under way. On August 1st, I had written and wired the <person
                reg="Cummings, Homer Stile">Secretary of State</person> for advice, and was informed
            that the <org>United States Government</org> was not advising American citizens against
            going to China.</p>
        <p>Daily radio reports, however, from <place reg="Shanghai, China">Shanghai</place> revealed
            that the “incident” was growing more and more serious. By August 14th communications
            with Shanghai were entirely cut off, and by the time we arrived at <place
                reg="Kobe, Japan">Kobe</place>, no one knew what the actual conditions there might
            be. There we were met by <person reg="Rose, Florence">Florence Rose</person>, staff
            secretary, who had preceded us to China and who had managed to return to Kobe after the
            Shanghai bombardment. Her account of the terror and horror that accompanied successive
            bombings of sections of Shanghai crowded with helpless refugees, including the heart of
            the International Settlement where she had gone for greater safety, made it evident that
            all plans for China at this time must be abandoned.</p>
        <p>We were met at Kobe also by <person reg="Kato, Shidzue Ishimoto">Baroness Shidzue
                Ishimoto</person>, who has bravely and gallantly led the birth control movement in
                <place>Japan</place>. Several reporters were also present, and in spite of the fact
            that war news was dominating the front pages of the Japanese and English papers
            published in Japan, the subject of birth control took its place as one of the
            outstanding topics of interest. The day after our arrival at Kobe, the <title type="journal">Japan
                Chronicle</title> devoted two columns in its leading editorial to my return to Japan
            and the significance of birth control to the future welfare of the country. In fact,
            throughout our stay there were daily interviews with the press, and every activity had
            some mention in both the foreign and Japanese press.</p>
        <p>There is a vast difference in the Japan of 1937 and the Japan of 1922, at which time I
            made my first visit. In 1922 the population of Japan was 64 millions. Since then it has
            been increasing by from 800,000 to one million annually. Japan has annexed
                <place>Manchukuo</place>, and has thus added vastly to her territory. In spite of
            this increased territory, and its supplies of coal, ore, and petroleum, Japan’s
            ambitions have not been fulfilled. She is keenly disappointed over the natural resources
            of Manchukuo, and she is still land-hungry. Japan seeks more natural resources to build
            up her industries to feed her ever-increasing population. Owing to her mountainous,
            untillable acreage, Japan, like <place>Italy</place>, is one of the most densely
            populated countries in the world. As far back as 1925, Professor <person
                reg="Thompson, Warren S.">Warren Thompson</person>, in his brilliant analysis of the
            population problem, named Italy and Japan and <place>Germany</place> as “<q who="THOWA"
                >danger spots</q>” of the world. Japan is fulfilling that prophecy, and not only are
            these countries the danger spots of the world, but they are the destroyers of our
            civilization through their ruthless method of waging arrogant warfare against innocent,
            peaceful peoples.</p>
        <p>Throughout Japan, especially in the cities, one notes the rapid Westernization. Not only
            in the broad, paved streets, the automobiles, the Western costumes of the men and the
            children; but also in the restaurants, in the use of knives and forks and spoons, high
            tables, iced tea, and even air-cooled systems, is the change noted. The rickshaw is fast
            disappearing. While many of the women still wear their kimonos and clogs and keep their
            old coiffure, the more educated women, particularly those who have traveled abroad, have
            already adopted the “bob” and prefer western chic costumes of French or American design.
            Baroness Ishimoto laughingly states that the only time she wears a kimono is when she
            visits <place reg="United States">America</place>!</p>
        <p>I was disappointed, however, to find that the progress of the women of Japan has been
            retarded. They have not been able to maintain the advances they had made as far back as
            1922. Then they were making rapid strides on the wings of enlightenment in education,
            but soon after the earthquake the reactionary forces of government set up a strong,
            bureaucratic, militaristic government, and women since have not been allowed the natural
            freedom of evolutionary progress. While there is a certain equality of education in the
            lower grades, women are not granted degrees in their colleges and universities, and of
            all the women who have been allowed to attend medical universities, only a bare sixteen
            have been granted medical degrees, through “special dispensation.”</p>
        <p>Due to the courteous hospitality of the <person reg="Ichita, Kobashi">Mayor of <place
                    reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokyo</place></person>, we were officially received at his
            request by the <person reg="Unknown">Commissioner of Health of Tokyo</person> and
            his staff in the beautiful and picturesque <org>Kiyosumi Garden</org>, reserved for such occasions.
            The <person reg="Unknown">Director of the Tokyo Division of Hygiene</person>, a
                <org reg="Rockefeller Foundation">Rockefeller</org> fellowship physician of vision,
            assisted in the arrangements for this reception, and a staff <person reg="Unknown"
                >member</person> of <org>St. Luke’s International Hospital</org> graciously acted as
            interpreter. Among those present were directors and representatives of many public
            health institutions in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Contrary to American custom, in his “official capacity” the Commissioner welcomed us,
            agreeing that the cause of birth control was noble and good, but “unofficially” he
            expressed himself as being uncertain where he stood because of the difference between
                “<q who="UNK">perpendicular versus horizontal morality</q>” of the two
            civilizations. In Japan, the Commissioner claimed, morals came down “<q who="UNK"
                >perpendicular</q>” from the <person reg="Hirohito (Japan)">Emperor</person> to the head of
            the family, on downwards, to the husband and then down to the wife, whereas, in the
            Western countries there is a “horizontal” morality or equality of men and women, husband
            and wife. In other words, behind the objections to birth control lies the fact that it
            is going to give woman more power, greater freedom, and a greater chance to develop her
            personality; and from this growth her economic dependence on man, and on the male
            members of her family clan, will be lessened.</p>
        <p>On the evening of the same day a meeting was held at the St. Luke’s International
            Hospital. This meeting was arranged and presided over by the <person reg="Unknown"
                >President</person> of the <org>Japanese Gynecological Society</org>. Over 300
            professional people assembled, and the Chairman informed me later that every outstanding
            medical authority who was in Tokyo at the time was present at the meeting. Also
            attending were 25 public health nurses, now receiving training at St. Luke’s
            International Hospital, as well as the officials of leading organizations of midwives,
            who hold a respected position in Japan. They represent an important link in the public
            health system, as many communities are solely dependent upon midwives for any medical
            service whatever. Prominent social workers, and individuals active in community projects
            were also present at this meeting, which was not open to the public. Altogether it was
            an influential group which, if once authorized to act, could exert a far-reaching
            influence in the curtailment and elimination of many social and health problems that now
            confront civil and health authorities.</p>
        <p>A national campaign of public health is just raising its head in Japan, and through the
            establishment of the new <org reg="Japan Public Health Institute">Public Health
                Institute</org>, a gift of the <org>Rockefeller Foundation</org>, which will open
            next year, there will be a thousand or more professional positions open to the
            professions in the rural districts. This should be an excellent opportunity for the
            mothers in outlying districts to receive medical aid. If birth control could go hand in
            hand with public health instruction, it would not only be a blessing in the reduction of
            maternal and infant mortality, but also an indirect means of bringing peace on earth and
            good will to the mothers and fathers of Nippon.</p>
        <p>Most encouraging was the gathering held to celebrate the opening of the first modern
            birth control clinic in Japan. While Baroness Ishimoto has, in the past, single-handed
            practically, carried on birth control service and educational work under great
            difficulties, this new clinic is the first clinic comparable to those in Western
            countries. The clinic will be open every day including Sundays, with a medical woman in
            charge, regular schedules will be kept, medical examinations given, scientific, accurate
            records maintained, and in general the new clinic will conform to the standards of the
                <org>Birth Control Clinic Research Bureau</org>, with which it is affiliated.</p>
        <p>We congratulate Baroness Ishimoto and her co-workers; and feel that now in Japan the work
            has started on its way to the goal of eventual adoption by medical and public health
            authorities.</p>
        <p>Although it was not my intention to do more than make a few social visits in Japan, it
            happened that a great deal has been started in many directions.</p>
        <p>One of the <person reg="Unknown">foremost gynecologists</person> has agreed to
            institute and to carry on a piece of research on Foam Powder under his direction in his
                <org reg="Unknown">Gynecology and Obstetrics Department at a leading
                hospital</org>. It had also been my hope to visit <place>Korea</place> en route to
                <place reg="Beijing, China">Peiping</place>, but this proved impossible.
            Arrangements however were made for a medical social worker from <place
                reg="Seoul, Korea">Seoul</place>, who has been cooperating with <person
                reg="Kaufman, Alvin R. ">Mr. A. Kaufman</person> of <place>Canada</place> in doing
            birth control work in Korea, to also set up a Foam Powder project among the Koreans, and
            to keep suitable records.</p>
        <p>In many directions excellent contracts were made, and renewed impetus given to our
            courageous co-worker, Baroness Ishimoto, in her ceaseless struggle to carry birth
            control to the mothers of her country. One can never foresee what may happen in a
            militaristic country, and so the future is still dark and overclouded, but with the
            cooperation offered by many of the outstanding medical men and the approaching
            inauguration of a public health program, I dare hope that the seeds planted may
            eventually bear flourishing fruit.</p>
        <p>* The group consisted of <person reg="Brush, Dorothy Hamilton">Mrs. Alexander C.
                Dick</person>, <person reg="Parker, Joanne">Mrs. Joanne Parker</person>, Mrs.
