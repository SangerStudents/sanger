        <p>The whole future of woman is thus placed <del>into</del> under the power of the <org
                reg="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Church</org> without leaving to her the least
            choice in the matter whatsoever.</p>
        <p>It takes with it the whole life of woman--an eternity of circumstances--It
                <del>asks</del>
            <add>requires</add> obedience of its own adherents but servitude of the rest of us. The
            condition of woman becomes a vassal.</p>
        <p>The R. Church issues commands to its adherents who, tho citizens of this country obey
            these commands against our constitutional rights. </p>
        <p>It is annihilating our liberties and establishing its rules &amp; dominion in its
            place.</p>
        <p>Our honor, our interest, Everything we have calls loudly to us to take our stand &amp;
            maintain it.</p>
        <p>If we review the part this Church has acted toward women, we shall find Everything which
            ought to make its adherents ashamed--vulgar abuse, bullying, aggressive dominance,
            tyrannical insults. </p>
        <p>Women have through the centuries suffered with patience &amp; seldom in despair. </p>
        <p>Their history is not marked by great battles or events and <del>takes</del>
            <add>occupies</add> but a brief chapter not only the fate of woman but in <place
                reg="United States">America</place> but America itself stands trembling on the point
            of coercion. </p>
