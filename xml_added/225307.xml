        <head>Birth Control for Bermuda</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET SANGER</person></byline>
        <p>It is encouraging to find one spot on the earth where officials and the government have
            the vision to foresee that the adoption of certain policies at present can prevent
            adverse and deplorable conditions later on. <place>Bermuda</place> is the one place
            where statesmanship is really in action, and where an attempt is under way now to
            forestall the evil effects that eventually result from an uncontrolled population growth
            in a limited area.</p>
        <p>At the invitation of the <org>Bermuda Health Department</org>, I went to Bermuda to
            confer with the leaders of its health and public activities and to discuss with them the
            possibilities of organizing centers for the dissemination of birth control knowledge in
            Bermuda. I stayed in Bermuda for two weeks and had occasion to speak before a large
            number of groups, both in <place reg="Hamilton, Bermuda">Hamilton</place> and in <place
                reg="St. George, Bermuda">St. George</place>. Three of the meetings took place at
            the <org reg="Bermuda House of Assembly">House of Assembly</org>. Among those present
            were members of the Assembly and of the <org reg="Bermuda Legislative Council"
                >Legislative Council</org>, representatives of the <org
                reg="Bermuda Board of Health">Board of Health</org>, and His Lordship, the <person
                reg="Browne, Arthur Heber">Bishop of Bermuda</person>. Col. <person
                reg="Dill, Thomas Melville, Colonel">Dill</person>, the Attorney General, was in the
            chair. A special meeting for the medical profession was held at the Department of Health
            office in Hamilton.</p>
        <p>The population of Bermuda is at present about 30,000 having increased some 10,000 within
            less than ten years. With only 19 square miles to the Island, its population density is
            now greater than that of <place>Hong Kong</place>, <place>Malta</place> or
                <place>Gibraltar</place>. About 60% of the population is colored. The birth rate is
            very much higher among the colored than among the white. In 1936, the birth rate for the
            white population was 16.4, and for the colored 29.2. The death rates for the same year
            were 8.8 for whites and 9.6 for the colored, with an infant mortality of 45.8 and 52.9
            respectively.</p>
        <p>The increase in population appears to be far too rapid for the future peace and comfort
            of the Island. At present the general socio-economic conditions are satisfactory. There
            is no unemployment and no relief; there are no income or inheritance taxes, and the
            average wage for unskilled workers is from $15 to $18 per week. It is a tourist place,
            and as long as people continue to travel, Bermuda can be prosperous and happy. But
            Bermuda looks to the future, and the present Governor, Lieut. Gen. <person
                reg="Hildyard, Reginal John Thoroton">R. J. T. Hildyard</person>, an army man of
            strong personality, is a keen executive and anxious to see that the population of
            Bermuda should keep its standards high and retain the conditions of harmony, respect,
            peace and good will that obtain at the present time. This can be accomplished, it is
            felt, only if the population increases slowly, allowing for its assimilation into the
            system now prevailing.</p>
        <p>Among doctors, nurses, officials and the public there was general enthusiasm for the
            project of disseminating more widely contraceptive information. The young clergymen,
            too, were behind the plan unqualifiedly, although there was some opposition from the
            elderly Protestant Episcopalian Bishop. As a result of these conferences and
            discussions, Bermuda is now planning to organize an active birth control program, and
            two physicians will be sent to <place reg="United States">America</place> to observe and
            train at the <org>Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</org> and to acquaint
            themselves with the modern contraceptive techniques employed in this country.</p>
        <p>Bermuda will soon take its place as one of the few countries of the world where the
            dissemination of birth control information is sponsored by the government. Two clinics
            will be opened, one for the care of white women and the other for the colored, and the
            expenses of the clinics will be borne by the Colonial Government.</p>
        <p>Bermuda is fortunate in having statesmanship at its head. It will be of keen interest to
            watch its future development under an advanced and rational population policy.</p>
