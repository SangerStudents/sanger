        <head>A Parents' Problem or Woman's?</head>
        <byline>By Margaret Sanger</byline>
        <p>Many people who believe in Birth Control as the means of voluntary motherhood say that
            the propaganda of the movement is directed too much to women and too little to men. They
            contend that the appeal should be to men quite as much as to women and that a strong
            effort should be made to arouse the masculine half of humanity to its responsibilities
            in relation to the evils growing out of the enslavement of the reproductive
            function.</p>
        <p>It is true that the propaganda of the Birth Control movement in America has been
            addressed almost entirely to women. It has been couched in the terms of woman's
            experience. Its prime importance to her has been continuously and consistently stressed.
            The reason for this course is at once fundamental and practical.</p>
        <p>The basic freedom of the world is woman's freedom. A free race cannot be born of slave
            mothers. A woman enchained cannot choose but give a measure of bondage to her sons and
            daughters. No woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body. No
            woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will
            not be a mother.</p>
        <p>It does not greatly alter the case that some women call themselves free because they earn
            their own livings, while others profess freedom because they defy the conventions of sex
            relationship. She who earns her own living gains a sort of freedom that is not to be
            undervalued but in quality and in quantity it is of little account beside the
            untrammeled choice of mating or not mating, of being a mother or not being a mother. She
            gains food and clothing and shelter, at least, without submitting to the charity of her
            companion, but the earning of her own living does not give her the development of her
            inner sex urge, far deeper and more powerful in its outworkings than any of these mere
            externals. In order to have that development, she must still meet and solve the problem
            of motherhood.</p>
        <p>With the so-called "<q>free</q>" woman, who chooses a mate in defiance of convention,
            freedom is largely a question of character and audacity. If she does attain to an
            unrestrained choice of a mate, she is still in a position to be enslaved through her
            reproductive powers. Indeed, the pressure of law and custom upon the woman not legally
            married is likely to make her more of a slave than the woman fortunate enough to marry
            the man of <emph rend="italics">her</emph> choice.</p>
        <p>Look at it from any standpoint you will, suggest any solution you will, conventional or
            unconventional, sanctioned by law or in defiance of law, woman is in the same position,
            fundamentally, until she is able to determine for herself whether she will be a mother
            and to fix the number of her offspring. This unavoidable situation is alone enough to
            make Birth Control, first of all a woman's problem. On the very face of the matter,
            voluntary motherhood is chiefly the concern of the mother.</p>
        <p>It is persistently urged, however, that since sex expression is the act of two, the
            responsibility of controlling the results should not be shifted to woman. Is it fair, we
            are asked, to give her the task of protecting herself when she is, perhaps, less rugged
            in physique than her mate, and has, at all events, the normal, periodic inconvenience of
            her sex?</p>
        <p>We must examine this phase of the problem in two lights â€“ that of the ideal and of the
            conditions working toward the ideal. In an ideal society, no doubt, Birth Control would
            become the concern of the man as well as the woman. The hard, inescapable fact which we
            encounter today is that man has not only refused any such responsibility but has
            individually and collectively sought to prevent woman from obtaining knowledge by which
            she could assume this responsibility for herself. She is still in the position of a
            dependent today because her mate has refused to consider her as an individual apart from
            his needs. She is still bound because she has in the past left the solution of the
            problem to him. Having left it to him, she finds that instead of rights, she has only
            such privileges as she has gained by petitioning, coaxing, and cozening. Having left it
            to him, she is exploited, driven and enslaved to his desires.</p>
        <p>While it is true that he suffers many evils as the consequence of this situation, she
            suffers vastly more. While it is true that he should be awakened to the cause of these
            evils, we know that they come home to her with crush-force every day. It is she who has
            the long burden of carrying, bearing and rearing the unwanted children. It is she who
            must watch bedside the beds of pain where lie the babies who suffer because they have
            come into overcrowded homes. It is her heart that the sight of the deformed, the
            subnormal, the undernourished, the overworked child smites first and oftenest and
            hardest. It is her love life that dies first in the fear of undesired pregnancy; it is
            her self-expression that perishes first and most hopelessly because of it.</p>
        <p>Conditions, rather than theories, facts, rather than dreams, govern the problem. They
            place it squarely upon the shoulders of woman. She has learned that whatever the moral
            responsibility of the man in this direction may be, he does not discharge it. She has
            learned that, loveable and considerate as the individual husband may be, she has nothing
            to expect from men in the mass, when they make laws and decree customs. She knows that
            regardless of what ought to be, the brutal, unavoidable fact is that she will never
            receive her freedom until she takes it for herself.</p>
        <p>Having learned this much, she has yet something more to learn. Women are too much
            inclined to follow in footsteps of men, to try to think as men think, to try to solve
            the general problems of life as men solve them. If after attaining their freedom, women
            accept conditions in the spheres of government, industry, art, morals and religion as
            they find them, they will be but taking a leaf out of man's book. The woman is not
            needed to do man's work. She is not needed to think man's thoughts. She need not fear
            that the masculine spirit, almost universally dominant, will fail to take care of its
            own. Her mission is not to enhance the masculine spirit, but to express the feminine
            spirit; hers is not to preserve a man-made world but to create a human world by the
            infusion of the feminine element into all of its activities.</p>
        <p>Woman must not accept; she must challenge. She must not be told how to use her freedom;
            she must find out for herself. She must not be awed by that which has been built up
            around her; she must reverence that within her which struggles for expression. Her eyes
            must be less upon what is--more clearly upon what should be. She must listen only with a
            frankly questioning attitude to the dogmatized, fossilized opinions of church, state and
            society. When she chooses her new, free course of action, it must be in the light of her
            own opinion â€“ of her own intuition. Only so can she give play to the feminine spirit.
            Only thus can she free her mate from the bondage which he wrought for himself when he
            wrought hers. Only thus can she restore to him that of which he robbed himself in
            restricting her. Only thus can she remake the world.</p>
        <p>The world is, indeed, hers to remake; it is hers to build and to recreate. Even as she
            has permitted the suppression of her own feminine element and the consequent
            impoverishment of industry, art, letters, sciences, morals, religions, and social
            intercourse, so it is hers to enrich all these.</p>
        <p>Woman must have her freedom--the fundamental freedom of choosing whether or not she shall
            be a mother and how many children she will have. Regardless of what man's attitude may
            be, that problem is hers--and before it can be his, it is hers alone.</p>
        <p>She goes through "<q who="BIB">the valley of the shadow of death</q>" alone, each time a
            babe is born. As it is the right neither of man nor the state to coerce her into this
            ordeal, so it is her right to decide whether she will endure it. That right to decide
            imposes upon her the duty of clearing the way to knowledge by which she may make and
            carry out the decision.</p>
        <p>Birth Control is a woman's problem. The quicker she accepts it as hers and hers alone,
            the quicker will society respect motherhood. The quicker, too, will the world be made a
            fit place for children to live.</p>
