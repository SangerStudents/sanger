  <head>Editorial</head>
  <p>To all who are familiar with the aims and principles of the <org>American
    Birth Control League</org>, it is quite unnecessary to reiterate that one of
   our basic tenets includes the racial perpetuation of health, intelligence,
   talent and all human traits and values of benefit to the community. As I have
   pointed out elsewhere and repeated many times, the key-word of our program is
    <emph rend="italics">control</emph>. If our critics would take the trouble
   of looking up the definition of control in any standard dictionary, it would
   become evident to them that this word means intelligence, mastery and
   guidance of an activity. Therefore the control of the procreative faculty
   means, fundamentally, the application of intelligent direction and guidance
   of this function, with complete consideration of the factors and the lives
   involved. </p>
  <p>Despite our indefatigable efforts, confusion still persists in the public
   mind. It is imperative that we should aim always for clarity in the
   definition of our program, and bend all our efforts toward dispelling this
   confusion, instead of adding to it. To influence the public mind we must
   present clear cut, sharply accentuated images of our ideal, and unconfused
   lucid statements of our aims.</p>
  <p>It is my belief that the so-called "eugenic"
   resolution, passed at the final session of the <org>Sixth International
    Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference</org>, has created a lamentable
   confusion. Instead of directing public opinion toward a better understanding
   of our program, it was interpreted by the press as indicating that we
   believed we could actually increase the size of families among the
    "superior" classes by passing resolutions recommending
   larger families. An explanation of our fundamental position thus becomes
   necessary. </p>
  <p>After the conference had been practically adjourned, and during a sparsely
   attended meeting on March 31st, held simply to adjust certain minor details,
   the courtesy of the floor was extended to Dr. <person>Roswell H.
    Johnson</person>, who had been unable to attend the regular sessions. Dr.
   Johnson introduced the following resolution:</p><p><q rend="blockquote">"<emph
     rend="italics">Resolved</emph>, that this Conference believes that persons
    whose progeny give promise of being of decided value to the community should
    be encouraged to bear as large families, properly spaced, as they feel they
    feasibly can."</q> </p><p>Under the rules of the conference, the resolution was out
   of order, and if it had been introduced at the fully attended Eugenics
   session, it is very doubtful if it would have passed. But it was passed. And
   it was seized upon immediately for editorial comment and criticism, the press
   re-echoing the questions that had been asked by opponents of the resolution
   who voiced their opposition when it was first presented at that final
   session.</p>
  <p>In the first place, it would seem impossible to predetermine those
    "superior" persons whose progeny would for certain give
   such promise, or to deny the possibility of such promise to many who might
   from all external standards be deemed "inferior." In the
   next place we doubt seriously that those qualities desirable for racial
   perpetuation can be effectively transmitted from generation to generation by
   the simple expedient of merely increasing the size of the family, an increase
    "encouraged" by the passing of resolutions directed
   toward prospective parents quite able to make their own decisions and to
   manage their own affairs. Such words and such resolutions, it is obvious, are
   wasted and irrelevant, especially when coming from a body of avowed advocates
   of Birth Control.</p>
  <p>Surely it is not within the province of our program to offer gratuitous
   advice to intelligent adults who have achieved control and direction of their
   parental function as to the number of additional children they shall bring
   into the world. This is precisely the problem they must solve for themselves.
   It is not only presumptuous but impertinent for any outsider or body of
   outsiders to assume that such parents <emph rend="italics">have not already
    decided for themselves</emph> the proper size and spacing and feasibility of
   increasing their family.</p>
  <p>If we sought as an organization to increase and extend our program to
   encourage larger families among the biologically superior classes, instead of
   concentrating upon the more important task of educating those vast sections
   of the human family to which the beneficent instrument of contraception has
   been denied, our efforts would be lamentably scattered and weakened.</p>
  <p>The so-called "eugenic" resolution has been of decided
   value in the immediate and lively criticism it has stimulated, not only in
   the daily press of this country, but in <place>England</place> as well.
   Analyzed and dissected, it reveals its lack of precise clarity and rigorous
   thinking. It is open to the same refutation that have been evoked by many of
   the orthodox proposals of the Eugenics school -- their tendency to place too
   much faith in external direction and quasi-paternal direction of breeding,
   combined with a bland indifference to the importance of liberated
   self-direction. As opposed to this attitude, the program of Birth Control is
   more constructive and more concrete.</p>
  <p>We assume that potentially at least all normal children who are brought
   into the world give promise of being of value to the community; that if the
   potential child promises to be the contrary, a burden, a menace to the
   community and the race, its coming must be prevented; that the promise of the
   promising child is often over-balanced and destroyed by the preponderance of
   unwanted children; and that our fundamental and central task is to clear away
   those obstructions which now prohibit diseased, overburdened and
   poverty-stricken mothers from the control of the procreative function.
   Experience teaches us that these women are crying aloud for liberation from
   the slavery and bondage in which they find themselves. Until we give them the
   opportunity of properly spacing and determining for themselves the number of
   children they might <emph rend="italics">choose</emph> to bear, we cannot
   determine what promise lies buried in this vast submerged enslaved mass of
   humanity.</p>
  <p>Birth Control in itself, we claim, is thus a constructive, creative power
   for human regeneration. Birth Control in itself, urging not larger families
   but smaller families by the instrument of qualitative control, offers an
   instrument of liberation to overburdened humanity.</p>
  <p>With such tremendous tasks confronting us, and while our opponents, the
   militarists and the reactionaries, are incessantly urging the procreation of
   larger and larger families upon the fit and the unfit alike, we should beware
   the danger of confusing our own program with that of our opponents. We have
   sufficient faith in the fit to look out for themselves and their children.
   Our program on the other hand must remain sharp, distinct, crystallized,
   clear cut, aiming first and last for the release, from the vast deep
   reservoir of human potentiality, of the hidden treasure of talent and beauty
   and genius that lies untouched and unminted in the unprobed depths of the
   common race. Birth control, -- this is our undaunted challenge -- is the
   instrument by which these latent traits may be bred into radiant reality.</p>
