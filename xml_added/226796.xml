  <head>Editorial</head>
  <p>To all who are familiar with the aims and principles of the <org>American Birth Control
    League</org>, it is quite unnecessary to reiterate that one of our basic tenets includes the
   racial perpetuation of health, intelligence, talent and all human traits and values of benefit to
   the community. As I have pointed out elsewhere and repeated many times, the key-word of our
   program is <emph rend="italics">control</emph>. If our critics would take the trouble of looking
   up the definition of control in any standard dictionary, it would become evident to them that
   this word means intelligence, mastery and guidance of an activity. Therefore the control of the
   procreative faculty means, fundamentally, the application of intelligent direction and guidance
   of this function, with complete consideration of the factors and the lives involved. </p>
  <p>Despite our indefatigable efforts, confusion still persists in the public mind. It is
   imperative that we should aim always for clarity in the definition of our program, and bend all
   our efforts toward dispelling this confusion, instead of adding to it. To influence the public
   mind we must present clear cut, sharply accentuated images of our ideal, and unconfused lucid
   statements of our aims.</p>
  <p>It is my belief that the so-called "eugenic" resolution, passed at the final session of the
    <org reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 6th">Sixth International
    Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference</org>, has created a lamentable confusion. Instead
   of directing public opinion toward a better understanding of our program, it was interpreted by
   the press as indicating that we believed we could actually increase the size of families among
   the "superior" classes by passing resolutions recommending larger families. An explanation of our
   fundamental position thus becomes necessary. </p>
  <p>After the conference had been practically adjourned, and during a sparsely attended meeting on
   March 31st, held simply to adjust certain minor details, the courtesy of the floor was extended
   to Dr. <person reg="Johnson, Roswell H.">Roswell H. Johnson</person>, who had been unable to
   attend the regular sessions. Dr. Johnson introduced the following resolution:</p>
  <p><q rend="blockquote" who="JOHRO">"<emph rend="italics">Resolved</emph>, that this Conference
    believes that persons whose progeny give promise of being of decided value to the community
    should be encouraged to bear as large families, properly spaced, as they feel they feasibly
    can."</q>
  </p>
  <p>Under the rules of the conference, the resolution was out of order, and if it had been
   introduced at the fully attended Eugenics session, it is very doubtful if it would have passed.
   But it was passed. And it was seized upon immediately for editorial comment and criticism, the
   press re-echoing the questions that had been asked by opponents of the resolution who voiced
   their opposition when it was first presented at that final session.</p>
  <p>In the first place, it would seem impossible to predetermine those "superior" persons whose
   progeny would for certain give such promise, or to deny the possibility of such promise to many
   who might from all external standards be deemed "inferior." In the next place we doubt seriously
   that those qualities desirable for racial perpetuation can be effectively transmitted from
   generation to generation by the simple expedient of merely increasing the size of the family, an
   increase "encouraged" by the passing of resolutions directed toward prospective parents quite
   able to make their own decisions and to manage their own affairs. Such words and such
   resolutions, it is obvious, are wasted and irrelevant, especially when coming from a body of
   avowed advocates of Birth Control.</p>
  <p>Surely it is not within the province of our program to offer gratuitous advice to intelligent
   adults who have achieved control and direction of their parental function as to the number of
   additional children they shall bring into the world. This is precisely the problem they must
   solve for themselves. It is not only presumptuous but impertinent for any outsider or body of
   outsiders to assume that such parents <emph rend="italics">have not already decided for
    themselves</emph> the proper size and spacing and feasibility of increasing their family.</p>
  <p>If we sought as an organization to increase and extend our program to encourage larger families
   among the biologically superior classes, instead of concentrating upon the more important task of
   educating those vast sections of the human family to which the beneficent instrument of
   contraception has been denied, our efforts would be lamentably scattered and weakened.</p>
  <p>The so-called "eugenic" resolution has been of decided value in the immediate and lively
   criticism it has stimulated, not only in the daily press of this country, but in
    <place>England</place> as well. Analyzed and dissected, it reveals its lack of precise clarity
   and rigorous thinking. It is open to the same refutation that have been evoked by many of the
   orthodox proposals of the Eugenics school -- their tendency to place too much faith in external
   direction and quasi-paternal direction of breeding, combined with a bland indifference to the
   importance of liberated self-direction. As opposed to this attitude, the program of Birth Control
   is more constructive and more concrete.</p>
  <p>We assume that potentially at least all normal children who are brought into the world give
   promise of being of value to the community; that if the potential child promises to be the
   contrary, a burden, a menace to the community and the race, its coming must be prevented; that
   the promise of the promising child is often over-balanced and destroyed by the preponderance of
   unwanted children; and that our fundamental and central task is to clear away those obstructions
   which now prohibit diseased, overburdened and poverty-stricken mothers from the control of the
   procreative function. Experience teaches us that these women are crying aloud for liberation from
   the slavery and bondage in which they find themselves. Until we give them the opportunity of
   properly spacing and determining for themselves the number of children they might <emph
    rend="italics">choose</emph> to bear, we cannot determine what promise lies buried in this vast
   submerged enslaved mass of humanity.</p>
  <p>Birth Control in itself, we claim, is thus a constructive, creative power for human
   regeneration. Birth Control in itself, urging not larger families but smaller families by the
   instrument of qualitative control, offers an instrument of liberation to overburdened
   humanity.</p>
  <p>With such tremendous tasks confronting us, and while our opponents, the militarists and the
   reactionaries, are incessantly urging the procreation of larger and larger families upon the fit
   and the unfit alike, we should beware the danger of confusing our own program with that of our
   opponents. We have sufficient faith in the fit to look out for themselves and their children. Our
   program on the other hand must remain sharp, distinct, crystallized, clear cut, aiming first and
   last for the release, from the vast deep reservoir of human potentiality, of the hidden treasure
   of talent and beauty and genius that lies untouched and unminted in the unprobed depths of the
   common race. Birth control, -- this is our undaunted challenge -- is the instrument by which
   these latent traits may be bred into radiant reality.</p>
