        <byline>An Address Delivered by Margaret Sanger</byline>
        <p>It is only by looking back over the years that we can see how far our movement has come.
            It is only by contrasting the little band of pioneers represented by so many of my old
            friends here with the host of younger supporters that we can measure the acceptance
            which our ideas have achieved.</p>
        <p>But it is not enough to look backward with pride, justified as that pride may be. We must
            look forward with hope and confidence, too. The real lesson of the past is that it shows
            us what can be done for the future.</p>
        <p>Thirty years ago, only the most fortunate of women had any access at all to really
            reliable medical advice on the control of conception. Today such advice is available to
            millions, not only through the <org>Planned Parenthood Clinics</org> such as those
            maintained by your splendid <org
                reg="Planned Parenthood Association of the Chicago Area">Chicago Association</org>,
            but in the public health service of seven States, through a few hospitals and through
            many thousands of private physicians. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, millions of women still do not have easy access to this vital health
            service. Which we can be grateful for the work we have done, those of us who have been
            in this movement for a generation and more recognize that we cannot rest on our
            laurels--even if everyone were to agree that we have earned any such honor---until not
            only our own country but the whole world has the same benefits that are now accorded to
            the more fortunate.</p>
        <p>The real value, therefore, of reviewing the progress we have made so far, is that it
            points the way to progress to come.</p>
        <p>There are just a few things for which I take credit in this great humanitarian movement,
            and the first, which I consider much more important that most people do, is that I
            coined a term to call the movement by. A few of us got together, and we knew that there
            were such terms as “Malthusianism,” “Neo-Malthusianism,” and “Conscious generation,” but
            you know that people just could not even spell them, let alone pronounce them. We tried
            one term after another, including “Family Control,” and then “Birth Control” came, as it
            were, out of the air, and “Birth Control” it was. </p>
        <p>It needed a little describing, and so for years some of us went throughout the country,
            from east to west and north to south, defining it as “The conscious control of the
            birth-rate by means that prevent conception.” We emphasized the word “prevent”--prevent,
            not destroy, not to interfere with life, but to prevent when there was no life to
            destroy. We said “This is no more destruction of life than remaining single or living in
            celibacy.”</p>
        <p>We said “control,” and we did not mean “limit.” We did not mean one child or two
            children; we said “control,” and we emphasized that you control traffic and appetite and
            temper. We thought that those were two excellent words to pin to this idea. I consider
            that that was probably one of the best educational factors in the whole movement. While
            the name has since been changed, and I think very well, to “Planned Parenthood,” that
            simply means that the movement has gone on and got beyond where it needed to be
            explained, and we are getting into another realm.</p>
        <p>Another thing which was interesting and quite delightful was challenging the <person
                reg="Comstock, Anthony">Comstock</person> laws. It is impossible for those who did
            not live through those days to conceive what an atmosphere there was in the
                <place>United States</place> in 1912-14. A man named Anthony Comstock, more than
            thirty years before, conceived the idea, and influenced Congressmen and churchmen and
            others to accept it, that the only way to keep the people pure was to make laws to keep
            them pure, and so he went to Congress and was able to get a law passed which put
            contraception in with obscenity, and which made it a crime, punishable with five years’
            imprisonment and a 5,000 dollar fine, for anyone to send through the post any book or
            letter or article or information concerning contraception or where it might be obtained;
            and that did not exclude the medical profession;. In different States he also had laws
            passed which did not exclude the medical profession; and so for thirty years this
            man---fanatical and well-meaning--and his agents opened letters. They had more
            privileges than Congressmen. They opened parcels and packages from abroad, and
            especially from France, looking for contraceptives and for literature that might mention
            sex. The very words “gonorrhea” and “syphilis” were taboo, and whole papers were
            prevented from going through the U.S. mails if those words were included in any part of
            them.</p>
        <p>It was a serious matter; it was not just a question of threats. He sent people to jail.
            An <person reg="Harmon, Moses">editor 70 years old</person> was sent to the penitentiary
            and put to hard labour, breaking rocks; his crime was editing a magazine called the
                <title type="journal">Eugenics Review</title>. In the end the public indignation was
            aroused by the arrest of a dealer who had up in his window a beautiful picture of a
            little girl of about ten years of age, nude, with the sunlight in her hair, standing in
            a stream. It was so beautiful that crows gathered round the window to look at it, and
            the Comstock agent arrested them and the bookseller. This aroused the wrath of some of
            the friends of freedom, and it was not so easy for him to arrest people after that.</p>
        <p>This was the situation when, as someone said, “<q who="UNK"><person
                    reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> came upon the scene with three
                children in her arms and a wild look in her eye.</q>” I had the children, and I had
            the wild look too, because I had been working among women--poor, depressed, forgotten
            women--whose whole lives were lives of misery, who were asking people what they could do
            so as to not have another baby, because they had more children than they could take care
            of, and perhaps their husbands were out of work, yet more and more children came. Some
            mothers who had had large families were asking what to do to save their daughters from
            the hardships and the life of drudgery that they had experienced. Everywhere I went I
            found people with this problem. I myself, with three children and with a long period of
            tuberculosis, knew that this was a very important matter, and the question was just what
            to tell them, what to say.</p>
        <p>I was perfectly willing to tell them what to do, but what was I to tell them? There was
            nothing in the public libraries, and even in the medical libraries in New York all that
            I could find on the subject was a book by a <person reg="Unknown">German
                physician</person> with pages and pages on how wonderful it was to have children.
            That was as much as I could get from any medical treatise at that period.</p>
        <p>Going to <place>France</place> and to <place>Scotland</place> gave me a new idea of the
            importance of this question. I went to <place reg="Glasgow, Scotland">Glasgow</place> to
            see what municipal ownership had done for women and children. They had had municipal
            ownership there for 25 years, and had beautiful parks and houses. I found, however, that
            none of the apartment houses were built for more than four children, and I asked what
            would happen if there were five children in the family. I was told “<q who="UNK">We have
                no facilities for anyone with more than four children, and as a matter of fact we do
                not encourage people with more than one or two children to live in these houses,
                because after they have four children the parents are unable to take care of the
                houses or the children, so they have to go to other districts.</q>” I found families
            with seven or eight children down in the dockyard slums.</p>
        <p>That made me think that no matter what the political situation, no matter what the
            economic situation, unless something is done to help people to take care of themselves
            the best places in the world may be turned into slums.</p>
        <p>Then I saw France, where there was real family limitation, where back to the days of
                <person reg="Bonaparte, Napoleon">Napoleon</person> there had been some
            consideration given to children and to the responsibility of having children. That is
            important. French women thought not only of themselves but of their children, and far
            more care was given to the one or two children per family that I saw in France than to
            the children that I saw in Glasgow.</p>
        <p>That, then, was one of the reasons for my having a wild look. I realized that this thing
            could do far more than protect the individual women who had tuberculosis or kidney
            trouble and who would not live if she had children; it involved a very large social
            outlook as well.</p>
        <p>I decided, therefore, that I had to challenge the Comstock law. As things stood, we could
            not get anywhere; we could not get information from any other part of the world; we
            could not even discuss the matter without having difficulties and without being
            threatened with jail sentences. I accordingly got out a little pamphlet called Family
            Limitation, a very simple one, with what formulas I had found in Paris and elsewhere,
            the folklore ideas of contraception; but it served its purpose of bringing the Comstock
            law to heel.</p>
        <p>I had difficulty in getting it printed, because every printer whom we approached said “<q
                who="UNK">This means a jail sentence; this means Sing-Sing.</q>” Nevertheless, we
            found a courageous printer who printed the pamphlet at night, and it was all set. I
            could have been given about 45 years in prison. </p>
        <p>I printed 125,000 or more, and had them carefully wrapped in bundles, and then I took the
            boat for <place>England</place>. When I was in the middle of the ocean I gave the word,
            and these pamphlets went out to the miners and the cotton workers and throughout the
            country to people who needed then, and a judge and a district attorney and one of these
            Comstock officials. I said that I had come away to prepare for a trial, and that I felt
            that this was an important matter and the only way to call attention to these laws and
            get them changed. There was such a thing as dramatization of the situation.</p>
        <p>There is a wonderful statement that <person reg="Shaw, George Bernard">Shaw</person> made
            which I have used many times. He said that tragedies really do not amount to very much;
            if an aeroplane crashes a dozen or more people are killed, and that may also happen if a
            great theatre or other building catches fire; but then something is done to prevent the
            same sort of thing from happening again. The real tragedies of the world are the little,
            everyday, continuous miseries, day in and day out, year after year and sometimes century
            after century, which we took in our stride; we got used to them. I thought that that was
            very true of the women who were bearing children that they did not want, children that
            they had no right to have, that they ought not to have to bear in ignorance; and so I
            brought out this little pamphlet.</p>
        <p>I went to England, and I had a wonderful reception. I found that there were a great many
            people who rather liked law-breakers. My memory goes back to the very splendid help that
            I had from <person reg="Ellis, Havelock">Havelock Ellis</person>, <person
                reg="Wells, H. G.">H.G. Wells</person>, <person reg="Carpenter, Edward">Edward
                Carpenter</person>, <person reg="Keynes, John Maynard">J.M. Keynes</person>, and the
            wonderful <person reg="Drysdale, Charles Vickery"><person reg="Drysdale, Bessie Ingham"
                    >Drysdales</person></person>. Dr. <person reg="Vickery, Alice">Alice
                Vickery</person> and the whole Drysdale family had carried on this movement from the
            times of <person reg="Besant, Annie">Annie Besant</person> and <person
                reg="Bradlaugh, Charles">Bradlaugh</person>, and were real Malthusians in their
            teachings. They helped and guided me in my work. </p>
        <p>About the time, therefore, that I was prepared to appear in court and, I hoped, shake the
            foundations of the American continent, large numbers of people wrote to the <person
                reg="Clayton, Henry DeLamar">judge</person> telling their stories. Many wastepaper
            baskets were filled with their stories. He could not read them. He said to the attorney
                “<q who="CLAHE">Take these out. What are we doing to this Mrs. Sanger?</q>” In no
            time at all, the case was dropped. </p>
        <p>That was not much good; we did not get anywhere. A very <person reg="Content, Harold A."
                >distinguished attorney</person> said “<q who="CONHA">We don’t want to prosecute
                Mrs. Sanger, a little frail woman; she will never do this again. We know Mrs.
                Sanger</q>.” I said “Oh, do you?” I would not promise not to do it; I said “As long
            as these is a woman in the world that needs this information, I am afraid that I shall
            have to give it to her.”</p>
        <p>There was also an influential letter--and I would here pay tribute to <person
                reg="Stopes, Marie">Marie Stopes</person>, who initiated it--with distinguished
            names from England, signed by the <person reg="Barnes, Ernest W.">Bishop of
                Birmingham</person> and ten or twelve others, including H.G. Wells, whose name meant
            a great deal in America. That was sent to the <person reg="Wilson, Woodrow">President of
                the United States</person>, and the case was dropped. </p>
        <p>That, however, did not affect the Comstock law. It affected me; it freed me to go to the
            country and speak, but the law was still there. Comstock died, but the torch was handed
            on to others, and the law was still in operation, though not quite so viciously as
            before.</p>
        <p>While I was in <place>Europe</place>, I went to <place reg="Netherlands">Holland</place>
            and took a course in the technique of contraception, and so I was able to do something
            more practical than the pamphlet. I decided to set up in <place>New York</place> State,
            challenging the law, a <org reg="Brownsville Clinic">clinic</org>, very much on the
            lines of those in Holland, to which women could come and be given information suitable
            for them as individuals. That seemed to me to be the ideal way, especially in the
                <place>United States</place>, to have the information about contraceptives given.
            That clinic was closed in about ten days and everybody was arrested, but they went on
            hunger-strike and caused a great deal of concern to those tender men who liked tender
            women, but we won a court decision. We took it to the highest court in New York State,
            and at last we had a victory. It was laid down that if I had a medical practitioner it
            would be all right, and that any physician lawfully practising could give contraceptive
            information for the cure or prevention of disease. With that we were satisfied; it was
            one step forward, and the only decision that we had. It interpreted the New York State
            law, and at once we opened another clinic, which has been in operation ever since.</p>
        <p>We had Dr. <person reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer">Hannah Stone</person> as the first ever
            woman physician. She stood beside us, ready to take whatever came, as our medical
            director until her death. About 125,000 women have come to that clinic for instruction.
            We have another department, dealing with infertility, to help those who wish to have
            children, and under Dr. <person reg="Levine, Lena">Lena Levine</person> we have marriage
            guidance, and so we have expanded our work to cover those other factors which belong to
            sex education.</p>
        <p>Finally, we even got a court decision on the Federal law. We connived to get a package of
            pessaries to come from a <person reg="Koyama, Sakae">doctor in Japan</person> to a
            doctor in New York, and we said “Doctor to doctor. How about it?” The court decided that
            they could be received, doctor to doctor. We therefore had two decisions, and felt that
            we were able to go ahead. No one did it alone; we could not do it alone. There were
            thousands and thousands of people concerned. Every time I presented a case to an
            audience I felt that it was really their story. It really reached the people. We became
            the articulate spokesman for the women of America.</p>
        <p>To my great delight, I was invited to go to <place>Japan</place> and to talk there at a
            sort of round table meeting with some very distinguished people. <person reg="Einstein"
                >Einstein</person> was to speak on relativity, <person reg="Russell, Bertrand"
                >Bertrand Russell</person> was to speak on something or other that I have forgotten;
            I was to speak on population and peace, and H.G. Wells was to speak on reconstruction.
            When the time came, I was refused a visa by the Imperial <org>Japanese Government</org>
            and was stopped in <place>California</place>. On the boat which I was to have taken
            there were 125 very important Japanese coming from the <org>Washington Disarmament
                Conference</org>, including admirals and high officials in the Japanese Government.
            I felt that if only I could talk to them and convince them, Japan would not be going to
            war in a short time; because everyone knew that Japan would have to have war if she kept
            on increasing her population as she was increasing it, with a population half the size
            of that of the United States and an area not as large as California. All the doors of
            the world were closed against the Japanese, and they had no place to go except
                <place>South America</place>. <place>Australia</place>, <place>Canada</place> and
            the United States would not have them, and Europe was not taking very many of them; it
            did not have room.</p>
        <p>There then, was this terrific problem, and to my surprise, Japan did not want to hear it
            talked about. Some bright newspaperman, however, gave me the idea of going to
                <place>China</place> on the boat, and that was what I did; I got a visa for China,
            and spent a great deal of time talking to the Japanese. I had a meeting with them in one
            of the great saloons on the boat, and they asked questions. They tried to get me into
            Japan, but it was difficult. The <person reg="Scidmore, George H.">American
                Consul</person>--as usually happens on these occasions--was out of town and we could
            not reach him, and so Americans had to turn to the <person reg="Holmes, Ernest H."
                >British Consul</person> to get them into Japan. He pulled wires and arranged
            things, and I found that I was able to get into Japan after all.</p>
        <p>I had a wonderful reception; the women waited all day, from eight in the morning until
            midnight, to receive me. It was very interesting and indeed symbolic to see the way in
            which these Japanese women tried to express in English what this idea was going to mean
            in Japan. One woman said to me “<q who="UNK">Mrs. Sanger, we have been hearing about
                suffrage, but we are not interested. We have been hearing about women having
                equality with men, but we do not care. But when we heard about birth control, like
                the lightning, the Japanese women were on to that.</q>” I thought that that was very
            expressive--“like the lightning.” That is what women all over the world want, all the
            women of the world, everywhere; they want something which will allow them to take care
            of their children and give them a decent upbringing.</p>
        <p>In Japan, the officials took me to the police station and asked me what I was going to
            say. I found that my books had been translated without my permission, and I asked them
            how this had happened, but of course they never paid any attention to copyright rules;
            they just thought that knowledge must be good and must be free. I did not mind that
            particularly. Then we came to talk about birth control and what I was to say, and they
            went into a huddle and came back and said “<q who="UNK">You may talk as much as you wish
                on the intimate question of birth control and tall them all that they must do, but
                you must not mention population; that we do not believe in, and that is not part of
                the talk you must give our women.</q>” I said “I cannot talk about birth control
            among fishes; it means people. I have come to talk to women about birth control, and
            birth control means population.”</p>
        <p>I had many private meetings. I think that the only public one which they would allow was
            in the <org reg="Young Men's Christian Association">Y.M.C.A.</org>, which was again
            almost private. I never met a more alive and enthusiastic audience anywhere in the
            world. They felt and they knew what was happening; they knew that the militarists were
            trying to clutch the people. This was in 1921, and even then there was this feeling. One
            editorial on the subject said “<q who="UNK">The doors of the world have been shut in our
                faces. We will open them when we have a hundred million people. Might will make
                Right, and we will pay back that insult.</q>” That was in 1921. They were very
            bitter about the law that had been passed in the United States to bar Asiatics. The
            Japanese had found very fertile soil in California, and had hoped to send more and more
            of their surplus population there. </p>
        <p>When in Japan I had a cable from China, from Mr. <person reg="Shi, Hu">Hu-Shih</person>,
            who later became Ambassador to the United States. Bertrand Russell had been there and
            had upset their family life considerably with new ideas, and I came along with this one
            about spacing children, and they were a little confused. Finally, they said “<q
                who="UNK">we will accept this whole idea of birth control, if you will tell us how
                to have boys; that is all we need.</q>” I was not able to answer that one! China is,
            in a sense, not so well educated in this regard as we should like to have it. I have
            made three trips there since then. The medical profession has taken it up considerably,
            and the midwives also tried to do something to help, but in the midst of all this, while
            we were making headway, the war came, and the whole world has been disorganized since
            then.</p>
        <p>Clinics were set up in various places. <place>India</place> was one of the most
            encouraging. When people say that the religions of the Asiatics are against
            contraception, I beg to correct that error. I never met any religious opposition in
            India, except in <place reg="Travanacore, India">Travancore</place>, where there were
            thirty or forty Portuguese missionaries who walked out of the Congress of the <org
                reg="All-India Women's Conference">All India Women’s Conference</org>. Of all the
            women of the world, I have never met finer and more intelligent women than I found in
            India, and there is no question about that. I visited <person reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K."
                >Ghandi</person>, who did not believe in so-called “artificial” birth control; he
            believed in separation of husband and wife after they had had a number of children. He
            believed that India was overpopulated, and he knew that this was one great cause of
            misery and poverty, but he would not concede that contraception was not a sin. To him it
            was a sin, and I found it difficult to talk with him; I can talk anatomy and physiology,
            but when it comes to sin I am lost. In spite of that, these magnificent women passed a
            resolution to have contraceptive information and technique taught in all the
            municipalities under the guidance of the health services. That was a very courageous
            thing for them to do. I am sure that now, as they become more established and settled,
            you will see the women of India taking a prominent place throughout the world.</p>
        <p>I am talking too long, but I want to tell you of one other thing that happened. The
            Comstock laws led to the difficulty that in the United States we had no contraceptives
            at all. We began to talk about birth control, and people said to us “<q who="UNK">Well,
                what do we do?</q>” There was nothing practical or scientific. As a result of the
            course which I took at the Hague I found out about the diaphragm, , but it was
            impossible to get it back to the United States. Havelock Ellis told me that just before
            the first world war there had been in a medical journal the announcement of a
            contraceptive jelly that had come out in <place>Germany</place>, and had been registered
            as such and sold. It seemed wonderful, and I could hardly wait for the war to be over to
            go to Germany and find out about it. When the war was over, I went to Germany to find
            out what it was, not knowing the name of it or who it was that had invented or
            discovered it.</p>
        <p>I went to <place reg="Berlin, Germany">Berlin</place> and <place reg="Dresden, Germany"
                >Dresden</place> and to many other places that are now shattered and gone, and
            finally I found that there was a chemist at <place reg="Friedrichshafen, Germany"
                >Friedrichshafen</place>, near <place>Switzerland</place>, who had prepared this
            contraceptive jelly, but he would not give us the formula or tell us anything that was
            in it; he regarded it as something not to be disclosed. However, after a little
            persuasion--I did not leave the place for three days, and finally I broke him down--he
            said he would send some to a relative of his in <place reg="New York, NY">New
                York</place>. It was a specific for venereal disease, and so we could get it in. We
            straightened things out with the relative and found out all about it.</p>
        <p>From that time until now--and this is what is so appalling--those two things, the jelly
            and the diaphragm, have been the only things known. It seems absurd to me that we have
            been able to discover and make the atomic bomb and yet we have not yet got a really
            simple, good and harmless contraceptive.</p>
        <p> I think that that is the end of this story. I have rambled on, but I should like to end
            by saying this. I think that one of the most important things for us is to realize the
            situation in the world to-day. We have all been practical idealists, but I do not think
            that we are optimists. When people say the birth control movement needs no more support,
            no more crusading,--that everything is all right as far as we have gone; I cannot help
            thinking of the story of the man who went to the top of the Empire State Building in New
            York, to look out over the beautiful scene to be seen from there. The building is about
            a hundred stories high. In his enthusiasm for the view, he leaned over too far and fell
            over the parapet. As in his fall he was passing the fifteenth story, someone called out
            to him, and he shouted “<q who="UNK">Everything is all right as far as I’ve gone.</q>”
            As far as we have gone it is all right, but where are we going? The optimist is out of
            place to-day, as we face reality and the hard facts. To be too optimistic is not
            healthy.</p>
        <p>I feel that you are the people to carry on, to agitate and to educate the world. That is
            what needs doing; we must stir people up and make them think and feel and do, so that
            they do something that it is right to do for civilization. In the United States we are
            spending billions on so-called welfare. If a fraction of that money were put into
            building laboratories and employing technicians to discover a form of contraception that
            could be taken into the jungles and the slums, the farms and the factories, we could
            place our civilization on a firm road to survival. I have often repeated, and I repeat
            again, the words of <person reg="Hugo, Victor">Victor Hugo</person>; “<q who="HUGVI"
                >There is no force in the world so great as that of an idea whose hour has
                struck</q>.” I believe that the hour of <person reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert"
                >Malthus</person> has struck. </p>
