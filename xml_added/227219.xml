        <head>IS THIS THE TIME TO HAVE A CHILD?</head>
        <byline>By <person>MARGARET SANGER</person></byline>
        <head><emph rend="underline">SYNOPSIS</emph></head>
        <p>Many people these days are writing on the subject of “war brides”,
            and “war babies”. As one who lived through the last war, studied the
            effect of war conditions on the infants born then, also as the
            mother of three children, I feel qualified to add my voice of
            “advice” to the others.</p>
        <p>First of all the problem has always been and is more than ever now, a
            serious one. The emotional and spiritual need of many women for a
            child to replace the husband taken from her is great. Her abiding
            desire to create something in the image of the husband who may not
            return frequently blinds her to a consideration of other less
            emotional but equally important factors. to be considered</p>
        <p>It is difficult for the young wife to make herself calmly answer
            these questions. Will I be able to support this child in the event
            that my husband does not return--or even until he returns? Will my
            child suffer in the event of a prolonged war and the severe
            rationing of food, as children are suffering in
                <place>Europe</place>? Will my anxiety for the return of my
            husband affect the child even before he is born? What sort of world
            am I bringing him into?</p>
        <p>Is there any serious hereditary defect in my family or my husband's
            family which might be passed on to a child? Is my own physical
            condition good enough for my body to be able to stand the strains of
            pregnancy? Aside from these considerations there are other things to
            be considered now. There is scientific evidence to back up the
            effect of a mother's worry on the health of her child. Many
            endocrinologists agree that under such trying conditions as war,
            women should not bear children.</p>
        <p>But against all these considerations of science, caution and common
            sense, there is that first strong emotional urge for the woman left
            behind by her soldier husband to bear a child in his likeness. That
            this urge has outweighed everything else can be seen by the rapidly
            increasing birth rate, the bumper crop of more than 2,500,000 babies
            last year, the prospects for an even larger number this year, with
            conditions very much more trying and uncertain than they were a year
            ago.</p>
        <p><place reg="Pearl Harbor, Hawaii">Pearl Harbor</place> has done more
            than all the scolding, scorning, lecturing of the priests and
            prophets could ever do to raise the birth rate--even among the much
            maligned of college groups who have been scorned for the smallness
                <add>size</add> of their families.</p>
        <p>The human answer to the question “Is this the time to have a child?”
            can be found among those young women of child-bearing age who are
            deciding this difficult question for themselves. I interviewed ten
            of them, with varying opinions. I bow to their judgments, present
            their arguments to you, and assure you from the results that the
            country need not fear race suicide.</p>
        <p>The doctor son of a friend of mine announced to his startled mother a
            few weeks ago. “Helen and I are going to have a baby.”</p>
        <p>It was too late for anything but congratulations, all his mother
            could do was inquire. “Do you think this is a good time for it?”</p>
        <p>“Helen wants it,” he explained simply.</p>
        <p>Nelson, the son, is a fully accredited surgeon, enlisted in the navy
            for the duration, and expects to be sent off at any minute. Helen is
            a doctor almost through her internship at <org>Bellevue
                Hospital</org>. She is a very competent young person, with
            obviously good reasons for anything she does. Nelson's mother put
            the same question, “Do you think this is a good time to have a
            baby?” to her. “I’d go simply mad,” Helen said, “if anything
            happened to Nelson and I were left behind without some human
            expression of our love. It's the only thing that reconciles me to
            the possible tragedies of the future.”</p>
        <p>“How about your job?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, I’ve figured that all out. I’ll be through my internship three
            months before the baby is due, and I’ll keep on with it until
            then.”</p>
        <p>Helen thinks all women with medical training ought to be drafted into
            the <org reg="United States Army">army</org> or <org
                reg="United States Navy">navy</org>. As soon as she is able
            after having her child, she is going to go to work again wherever
            she is needed and take her baby with her. She is in the fortunate
            position of being able to earn enough to pay for a trained nurse to
            care for the baby while she is away from home.</p>
        <p>Not many women can have a baby and keep on with their work like
            Helen. But in the next few months thousands of girls and women will
            have to make the same decision about whether or not to have a baby.
            They must make it knowing that the husbands they love and marry may
            not be with them to help bring up their babies. In almost every case
            therefore, the woman will have to make this heroic, even tragic,
            decision. That many men feel the decision should be that of the
            woman can be seen from the many army letters that come to the
                <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc</org>. at 501
            Madison Avenue, <place reg="New York City, New York">New York
                City</place>. Most of the letters these days are from the young
            soldiers themselves who want their wives to have a knowledge of baby
            spacing so that the decision will be entirely theirs, not the result
            of emotion and accident. They write that they will be able to go off
            and be better soldiers if relieved of the fear they may have left a
            child behind for their wives to support in their absence. All of
            them say they want families when they return.</p>
        <p>Sally was the next young friend with whom I talked. She is
            twenty-six, and a bride of three months. Her husband is a salesman
            subject to call at any minute into the army.</p>
        <p>“Sally, isn't it time you were thinking about having a baby?” I asked
            her the other day.</p>
        <p>She looked at me with horror, as though she could not believe me
            serious. But I could tell the question had been troubling her deeply
            by the way the words tumbled out. “Have a baby now? In this horrible
            period when Joe may have to go into the war any minute? Why, I might
            never see him again. Why should I mess up things worse than they
            already are? What right have I to bring a baby into the world when I
            don't even know what's going to happen in the future. I’ve got no
            way of earning a living. What good is a one-finger typist? I
            couldn't even earn enough to keep myself alive, much less provide
            for a child. That's a crazy suggestion, M. S., to tell me to have a
            baby now.”</p>
        <p>I asked my friend, Peggy, what she thought about it. Peggy already
            has one child. She is thrillingly in love with her husband and is
            obsessed by the fear that he will be taken and that she may lose
            him. She wants to have another baby now more than if she thought he
            were going to be home. Her desire to perpetuate her husband's
            personality outweighs in her mind all other considerations.</p>
        <p>Barbara, on the other hand, definitely has decided not to have
            another baby now. When she married at 26, she made up her mind she
            would have a family of four. She still has approximately fifteen
            years ahead of her in which to have the other three. Her first baby,
            now six months old, was a Caesarian delivery, which automatically
            limits her safety in future pregnancies.</p>
        <p>“To have another baby now would be unfair all the way around,” she
            said to me. “It would be a double burden and worry for my husband as
            well as for myself. I’m a trained nurse. Even if I’m not drafted, I
            feel I ought to offer my services to my country, in its time of
            need. That would mean leaving my baby with some perfect stranger.
            There’ll be plenty of time for me to have another baby later
            on.”</p>
        <p>For the woman with children who must remain and care for the home
            there is another argument against having a baby now. In addition to
            the nutritional and economic obstacles, there is the effect on the
            other children. Life will be hard enough for them with their father
            away. If their mother's nerves are in good condition, she will
            perhaps be able to allay their fears. But if her nerves are always
            on the ragged edge, as will undoubtedly be the case if she is about
            to bear another child, they will be deprived of the calm and
            peaceful home life to which they are entitled.</p>
        <p>One certain thing I discovered from my informal survey; the American
            nation is in no danger of extinction. Eight of the ten wives with
            whom I spoke intend to have babies right away, war or no war. This
            is true in spite of the troubled question so many of the
            sophisticated young people ask themselves, “What right have I to
            bring a child into a world which provides no security for it? Isn't
            the country going to be snowed under with mountainous taxes which
            will have to be paid by generations still unborn? Why should I add
            an other life to help shoulder that burden?”</p>
        <p>I agree with them that the world of tomorrow is going to be a
            different world, how different none of us yet knows. Of one thing
            all true Americans are certain. The children born today will still
            have the privilege of growing up in a democracy. In their hands will
            be the opportunity to do any remaking that may be needed.</p>
        <p>It is up to us to leave American Civilization of the future in good
            hands. Whether that can best be served by women having children
            during the war period is a question for each woman to decide for
            herself, according to the factors which govern her individual
            case.</p>
        <p>One democratic right which greater numbers of women are enjoying
            during this war and which was denied to most during the last right
            is the to <emph>decide</emph> for themselves whether they shall have
            babies or not. Today there are more than 800 birth control services
            in the United States. There were none during the last war. <add>The
                    <org>Brownsville clinic</org> had been opened and promptly
                closed by the police</add>. Today, through the combined services
            of the <org reg="United Service Organization">USO</org> and the <org
                reg="Young Women's Christian Association">YWCA</org>, young
            women troubled by problems relating to war are able to seek wise
            council under the leadership of <add>Dr.</add>
            <person reg="Nelson, Janet Fowler">Janet Fowler Nelson</person>.
            There are more than 500 marriage council groups throughout the
            country which aim to give young women a better understanding of
            themselves, of their problems. Young women who wish to postpone
            their babies until steadier times are given the address of the
            nearest birth control clinic, just as those young women who feel
            that they are physically and economically able to care for a child
            are encouraged to add a new American to the nation.</p>
