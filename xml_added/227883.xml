    <docBody>
        <p>A young high school girl said to me recently, “<q who="UNK">What do you find to do with
                yourself these days, <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs. Sanger</person>, now that
                your fight for birth control has been won?</q>”</p>
        <p>After I’d assured her that the “fight” was still very much in progress I thought back to
            the days when it had been just that. Birth control, fifteen, twenty years ago was a
            lurid and sensational topic. Issues were clear cut and direct. The very term was one not
            mentioned in polite society, thanks to <person reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony
                Comstock</person> who had <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> classify
            it with “obscene, and filthy literature” in the legislative ban against it. Our
            struggles lacked the dignity they have today. Back in 1921, <person reg="Cox, Harold"
                >Harold Cox</person>, brilliant member of the English <org
                reg="United Kingdom Parliament">Parliament</org> and Editor of the <title
                type="journal">Edinburgh Review</title> was to speak with me at that early forum of
            free speech, <org>Town Hall</org>. Our subject was “<title type="article">Birth Control:
                Is it Moral?</title>”</p>
        <p>With astonishing directness Roman Catholic Archbishop <person reg="Hayes, Patrick J."
                >Patrick J. Hayes</person>, through his emissary Monsignor <person
                reg="Dineen, Joseph P.">Joseph P. Dineen</person>, closed the meeting before it even
            opened. We had grown accustomed to opposition, from the combination of the Comstock
            group even after his death, with the Roman Catholic hierarchy, but never had the
            interference been so brutally direct before. Time and again theatres, ballrooms where I
            was to speak were ordered closed before the meeting could be held. In city after city
            this occurred during the years, 1916, ‘17 and ‘18, but the climax was the now famous
            Town Hall incident which raised the issue throughout the country. Can one in public
            office use the power of that office to further his personal religious beliefs?</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox and I were met at the steps of the Town Hall that evening by policemen, barred
            from entering and told, “<q who="UNK">There ain’t gonna be no meeting. That’s all I
                know.</q>”</p>
        <p><person reg="Rublee, Juliet Barrett">Juliet Barrett Rublee</person>, one of the birth
            control pioneers, hurried with me to a phone booth, calling police headquarters. No one
            there knew of any orders to forbid the meeting. But still it was being stopped by direct
            orders of Monsignor Dineen to the police.</p>
        <p>I wedged my way in a side entrance under the arm of a protecting officer who mistook me
            for one of the “press.” Harold Cox had by this time managed to reach the platform. An
            officer barred the platform steps to me. Harold hauled me up beside the steps, grabbed a
            bunch of flowers from a bewildered messenger boy and shouted to the audience, “<q
                who="COXHA">Don’t leave! Here’s Mrs. Sanger</q>,” thrusting the flowers which were
            to have been presented as a grand finale into my hand.</p>
        <p>The vast audience, many of them important doctors and scientists, who had begun to leave
            their seats, returned. I began to talk but could not be heard. Ten times I tried to
            speak forcing the police finally to do what I wanted, deny me the right of free speech
            by arresting me.</p>
        <p><person reg="Kennedy, Anne">Anne Kennedy</person>, in charge of the meeting, tried to
            tell me what had happened before my arrival. When the house was half filled a man had
            come to the platform and told her. “<q who="DINJO">The meeting must be closed.</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="KENAN">Why?</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="DINJO">An indecent immoral subject is to be discussed. It cannot be
            held.</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="KENAN">On what authority? Are you from the police?</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="DINJO">No. I’m Monsignor Dineen, the Secretary of Archbishop Hayes.</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="KENAN">What right has he to interfere?</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="DINJO">He has the right.</q>” Turning to a <person reg="Donahue, Thomas"
                >policeman</person>, “<q who="DINJO">Captain speak up!</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="KENAN">Who are you?</q>” Anne demanded.</p>
        <p>“<q who="DONTH">I’m Captain Donahue of this district. The meeting must be
            stopped.</q>”</p>
        <p>We were taken to <org reg="New York City Police Department">police headquarters</org> in
            a patrol wagon and released on our own recognizances. The reporters wouldn’t believe
            that the <org reg="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</org> had taken over police
            power and actually closed the meeting. A <title type="journal">New York Times</title>
            man called <org>St. Patrick’s Cathedral</org> and asked Monsignor Dineen himself. “<q
                who="DINJO">Yes</q>,” he replied. “<q who="DINJO">We closed the meeting.</q>”</p>
        <p>No representatives of the church bothered to appear in <org>Magistrates court</org> the
            next morning to explain why they had dissolved an important gathering of adult and
            intelligent men and women and sent them home like naughty children. However the press,
            intrigued with the idea of <place reg="Rome, Italy">Rome</place> running the police
            department, visited Monsignor Dineen en masse for an explanation. He said the presence
            of four children at the meeting was sufficient reason for police action.</p>
        <p>It was pointed out to him that the four “children” he had spied were students of
            Professor <person reg="Moley, Raymond">Raymond Moley</person>’s sociology class at
                <org>Columbia University</org>. They were adults sporting the popular new “bobbed
            hair.”</p>
        <p>We had the hierarchy to thank for so publicizing our meeting that the second held shortly
            after, at the big <org>Park Theatre</org> in Columbus Circle was packed fifteen minutes
            after a single door was opened. Two thousand people, many of whom had never heard of
            birth control before Cardinal Hayes gave it nation-wide publicity, stood outside
            clamoring to get in, even climbing up the fire escapes. Orators were haranguing from
            soapboxes, men were pounding each other with their fists. Paulist fathers sold
            anti-birth control pamphlets.</p>
        <p>The press kept the birth control publicity alive for weeks, the <title type="journal">New
                York Times</title> going so far as to headline the fact that Archbishop Hayes had
            closed the meeting. The most conservative papers were placed in the trying situation of
            defending birth control advocates or endorsing a violation of the principle of free
            speech, which “<q who="UNK">must always find defenders if democracy is to
            survive</q>.”</p>
        <p>The hierarchy had turned a simple unheralded meeting into a cause celebre, giving our
            movement more publicity than it could have acquired in years of proceeding simply and
            scientifically on its way impeded.</p>
        <p>Eight years later in 1929, church officials again created nationwide publicity by their
            high-handed procedure in ordering a raid of the <org>Birth Control Clinical Research
                Bureau</org> in <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>. Not only supplies
            but confidential records as well were seized. This invasion of the highly confidential
            relation between doctor and patient aroused a storm of protest, resulting in strong
            support from the medical profession and community leaders. I will never forget that
            morning of April 15th. I had been up all night with my older son <person
                reg="Sanger, Stuart">Stuart</person>, who was suffering with mastoiditus, his
            temperature running very high. My Secretary, <person reg="Lifshiz, Anna">Anna
                Lifshiz</person>, telephoned and said, “<q who="LIFAN">The police are here at the
                clinic.</q>”</p>
        <p>For four years we had been giving help to poverty-stricken women, women broken in health,
            averting families tragedies by teaching distracted parents of many children how to space
            their babies. We were beginning to take heart; to believe that word of the good we were
            doing had spread in the neighborhood and outweighed the prejudices against us.</p>
        <p>I hurried to West Fifteenth street. The shade to the glass door was pulled down; the door
            locked. I was let in by the plain-clothes man from the <org
                reg="New York City Police Vice Squad">Vice Squad</org>, and found detectives
            hurrying around in terrific confusion. Dr. <person reg="Pissoort, Elizabeth">Elizabeth
                Pissoort</person> was outraged at the high-handedness of the raid; Dr. <person
                reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer">Hannah Stone</person> was equally furious but very aloof,
            although this was her first arrest. “<q who="STOHA">Isn’t it fantastic</q>,” she
            remarked. “<q who="STOHA">Only a few minutes ago a visiting physician from the Middle
                West asked one of the nurses whether we ever had any police interference, and the
                nurse told her, ‘Oh no, those days are over!</q>”</p>
        <p>Mrs. <person reg="Sullivan, Mary">Mary Sullivan</person>, head of the <org
                reg="New York City Policewomen's Bureau">City Policewomen’s Bureau</org>, was
            superintending the raid in person. But Patrolwoman <person reg="McNamara, Anna">Anna
                McNamara</person> took a far more active part, consulting a list in her hand,
            turning over the case histories in the files as swiftly as her fingers could move. Many
            of these contained the personal confessions of women, some of whom had entrusted us with
            knowledge that their husbands had venereal diseases or were insane. Not even the nurses
            had been allowed to see them. Now they were the common property of the police
            department, to be used by them in whatever manner they desired.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McNamara taunted me when I told her she had no right to touch private medical files.
            She had come to the clinic some time before for contraceptive advice, using the name
            Mrs. Tierney, and had received it after examination by two physicians, who found her
            suffering from rectocele, cystocele, prolapsus of the uterus, erosions, and
            retroversion.</p>
        <p>I shall never forget the color of Mrs. McNamara’s face when she heard this medical
            testimony recited several days later in Magistrates’ Court at the hearing. She was
            totally unprepared for this embarrassing revelation of her own organs. Months later she
            returned quietly to Dr. Stone to inquire if these findings were true and as serious as
            they sounded.</p>
        <p>A month after that dramatic hearing, the defendants were discharged. Again public
            indignation had been aroused at the high-handed methods used against us. Police
            Commissioner <person reg="Whalen, Grover A.">Grover A. Whalen</person>, still trying at
            that time to ferret out <person reg="Rothstein, Arnold">Arnold Rothstein</person>’s
            murder, had termed the raid a “<q who="WHAGR">routine matter</q>”, until Dr. <person
                reg="Williams, Linsley">Linsley Williams</person>, Director of the <org
                reg="New York Academy of Medicine">Academy of Medicine</org>, wrote a letter of
            protest. Then he apologized. Mary Sullivan was temporarily demoted.</p>
        <p>I was curious about what had caused the raid in the first place, and employed the
                <org>Burns Detective Agency</org> to sift the affair. Approximately fifty percent of
            our cases were being sent by social workers on the lower East and West Sides, a
            conglomerate of all peoples and classes, including Irish, Italians, and other Catholics.
            So many had benefitted and told their neighbors that others also were asking of their
            agencies how to get to our clinic. Catholic social workers, at a monthly meeting with
            officials of the Church, had sought guidance in replying to parishioners, and the
            ecclesiastics had been shocked to find that a clinic existed. Catholic policewoman had
            been summoned, Mary Sullivan had been chosen to wipe out the Clinical Research Bureau
            and Mrs. McNamara selected for the decoy.</p>
        <p>Again the raid was a tactical error by the opposition. Doctors, throughout the land, the
            world in fact, are highly sensitive about the sanctity of case records. On this issue
            they were firmly united in protest, no matter what they thought individually about birth
            control. Our calendars at the reopened clinic were filled three weeks in advance. None
            of our records was ever returned, but Roman Catholic patients whose cards had been
            seized reported that they received anonymous threats by telephone that if they continued
            to go to the clinic their private lives would be exposed.</p>
        <p>The <org reg="New York City Magistrate's Court">Magistrates Court</org> hearings and
            final decision in our favor was front page news in all the papers, the publicity
            continued for many months as it had in the previous case.</p>
        <p>These are but two of the many dramatic episodes in the “fight” for birth control. It’s
            still going on. Many important battles have been won, medical, legislative, but there is
            still so much to be accomplished.</p>
        <p>On the credit side, instead of a single clinic fighting for its life, there are now more
            than 800 throughout the country. Women who need knowledge of child spacing can find it
            in every state save those strongholds of the Catholic hierarchy,
                <place>Massachusetts</place> and <place>Connecticut</place>. But while outmoded laws
            have been invoked to close the clinics in these states, the South so frequently scorned
            as “backward,” has begun the move to place child spacing where it logically belongs,
            with its public health programs for maternal care. <place>North Carolina</place> was the
            first state to realize that something had to be done to lower tragically high infant and
            maternal death rates. <place>Mississippi</place> is the eighth state to fall in line and
            give state aid in family planning to those mothers who need it most since they cannot
            afford the services of private doctors.</p>
        <p>Another change has taken place. In a <title type="journal">Fortune</title> magazine poll of 1943, of
            women between 20 and 35 years, 84.9 approved of planned parenthood. Of the Roman
            Catholic women polled at this time, 69% encouraged by the anonymity of the poll
            registered approval. The clinics everywhere have as always a large Catholic
            registration. But more than that the church, cornered and moved by the obvious need and
            desire of its own members for some means of family planning, had to set its seal of
            approval on the “Rhythm Method,” that complicated and often inaccurate means of
            discovering a woman’ short cycle of fertility. By avoiding intercourse during this
            period she hopes to prevent the birth of children. So the church has approved the idea
            if not the actual methods which medical science endorse for family planning.</p>
        <p>Birth Control, the medical means by which planned parenthood may be achieved, emphasizes
            what those close to it always considered its greatest aim; the planning of healthy
            babies. In the planned parenthood movement, added stress is being placed on the
            encouragement of those physically and economically able, to have more babies. Aid is
            being extended increasingly to that estimated one family in ten of the population which
            suffers from infertility. More and more planned parenthood centers now provide treatment
            for childless couples or refer them to specialists able to help them. The <org
                reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned Parenthood Federation</org>
            at 501 Madison Avenue, New York City lists in its directory, along with birth control
            services, the small but growing number of fertility clinics throughout the country. As a
            guide to the unhappy couples who have been unsuccessful in having a child the Federation
            offers in its literature a new pamphlet “<title type="book">To Those Denied a Child.</title>”</p>
        <p>It is an interesting fact that more than a third of those couples seeking cures for
            infertility are rewarded by having babies of their own, and that people who want
            children are gaining the confidence to seek expert assistance. The male partner for many
            years scorned the idea he might be responsible for his wife’s inability to reproduce.
            Sterility to him wrongly implied impotency. Now with men showing as great an eagerness
            for perpetuating themselves as women always have, it has been found that the man is
            responsible in about one third of the cases.</p>
        <p>Governments throughout the world are increasingly conscious of social engineering,
            alarmed at imbalances in the birth rate, with the poorest families, in each land, those
            most handicapped in economic resources, health and education, carrying the major burden
            of bearing and rearing more than their proportion of the next generation’s children.
            This is one of the many problems planned parenthood will have to help solve in our
            war-torn world.</p>
        <p>There are so many things I might have said to my little high school friend who believed I
            could rest now with the “<q who="UNK">fight for birth control won</q>”. Does she realize
            what a long way we have come merely in the acceptance of the subject as a legitimate
            health topic? Such a short time ago no “lad” discussed birth control; it belonged with
            the other sex taboos of the age, which I feel sure we birth control pioneers helped to
            dissipate. When I feel gratified by our successes I remember that the struggle will
            never be won until every mother in this land and in the world has the democratic right
            to plan her children for that time when her physical strength and economic resources
            will give them the best chance for survival. The fight will not be won until we have
            brought this health measure out of the category “obscene”, until censorship is no longer
            the whim of postal clerks who can keep vital information from the mails. The latest move
            in these days when marriage counseling is sorely needed has been the ban of Dr. <person

        <p>We must make every effort to unshackle medicine from church domination. After a long and
            persistent struggle we have severed the state from this domination, <add>but</add>
            unfortunately we find that the Catholic church can still dictate in essential matters of
            health. It is time the weight of public opinion convinced government health agencies
            that the problems of reproduction should be treated as purely medical problems. When
            this happens every state will follow the lead of those eight southern states who have

        <p>We pioneers cannot completely relax and sigh with satisfaction, until planned parenthood,
            has ceased to be a cause, for which one has to fight, and become an accepted right of
            women throughout the world. Then and only then can we relax and say, “The battle is
            won.”</p>
