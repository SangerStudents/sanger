    <docBody>
        <p>A young high school girl said to me recently, “<q who="UNK">What do
                you find to do with yourself these days, <person
                    reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs. Sanger</person>, now that your
                fight for birth control has been won?</q>”</p>
        <p>After I'd assured her that the “fight” was still very much in
            progress I thought back to the days when it had been just that.
            Birth control, fifteen, twenty years ago was a lurid and sensational
            topic. Issues were clear cut and direct. The very term was one not
            mentioned in polite society, thanks to <person
                reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony Comstock</person> who had <org
                reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> classify it with
            “obscene, and filthy literature” in the legislative ban against it.
            Our struggles lacked the dignity they have today. Back in 1921,
                <person reg="Cox, Harold">Harold Cox</person>, brilliant member
            of the English <org reg="Parliament of the United Kingdom"
                >Parliament</org> and Editor of the <title>Edinburgh
                Review</title> was to speak with me at that early forum of free
            speech, <org>Town Hall</org>. Our subject was “<title>Birth Control:
                Is it Moral?</title>”</p>
        <p>With astonishing directness Roman Catholic Archbishop <person
                reg="Hayes, Patrick J.">Patrick J. Hayes</person>, through his
            emissary Monsignor <person reg="Dineen, Joseph P.">Joseph P.
                Dineen</person>, closed the meeting before it even opened. We
            had grown accustomed to opposition, from the combination of the
            Comstock group even after his death, with the Roman Catholic
            hierarchy, but never had the interference been so brutally direct
            before. Time and again theatres, ballrooms where I was to speak were
            ordered closed before the meeting could be held. In city after city
            this occurred during the years, 1916, ‘17 and ‘18, but the climax
            was the now famous Town Hall incident which raised the issue
            throughout the country. Can one in public office use the power of
            that office to further his personal religious beliefs?</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox and I were met at the steps of the Town Hall that evening by
            policemen, barred from entering and told, “<q who="UNK">There ain't
                gonna be no meeting. That's all I know.</q>”</p>
        <p><person reg="Rublee, Juliet Barrett">Juliet Barrett Rublee</person>,
            one of the birth control pioneers, hurried with me to a phone booth,
            calling police headquarters. No one there knew of any orders to
            forbid the meeting. But still it was being stopped by direct orders
            of Monsignor Dineen to the police.</p>
        <p>I wedged my way in a side entrance under the arm of a protecting
            officer who mistook me for one of the “press.” Harold Cox had by
            this time managed to reach the platform. An officer barred the
            platform steps to me. Harold hauled me up beside the steps, grabbed
            a bunch of flowers from a bewildered messenger boy and shouted to
            the audience, “<q who="COXHA">Don't leave! Here's Mrs. Sanger</q>,”
            thrusting the flowers which were to have been presented as a grand
            finale into my hand.</p>
        <p>The vast audience, many of them important doctors and scientists, who
            had begun to leave their seats, returned. I began to talk but could
            not be heard. Ten times I tried to speak forcing the police finally
            to do what I wanted, deny me the right of free speech by arresting
            me.</p>
        <p><person reg="Kennedy, Anne">Anne Kennedy</person>, in charge of the
            meeting, tried to tell me what had happened before my arrival. When
            the house was half filled a man had come to the platform and told
            her. “<q who="DINJO">The meeting must be closed.</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="KENAN">Why?</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="DINJO">An indecent immoral subject is to be discussed. It
                cannot be held.</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="KENAN">On what authority? Are you from the police?</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="DINJO">No. I’m Monsignor Dineen, the Secretary of Archbishop
                    <person reg="Hayes, Patrick Joseph">Hayes</person>.</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="KENAN">What right has he to interfere?</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="DINJO">He has the right.</q>” Turning to a <person
                reg="Donahue, Thomas">policeman</person>, “<q who="DINJO"
                >Captain speak up!</q>”</p>
        <p>“<q who="KENAN">Who are you?</q>” Anne demanded.</p>
        <p>“<q who="DONTH">I’m Captain Donahue of this district. The meeting
                must be stopped.</q>”</p>
        <p>We were taken to police headquarters in a patrol wagon and released
            on our own recognizances. The reporters wouldn't believe that the
                <org>Catholic Church</org> had taken over police power and
            actually closed the meeting. A <title>New York Times</title> man
            called <org>St. Patrick's Cathedral</org> and asked Monsignor Dineen
            himself. “<q who="DINJO">Yes</q>,” he replied. “<q who="DINJO">We
                closed the meeting.</q>”</p>
        <p>No representatives of the church bothered to appear in
                <org>Magistrates court</org> the next morning to explain why
            they had dissolved an important gathering of adult and intelligent
            men and women and sent them home like naughty children. However the
            press, intrigued with the idea of <place>Rome</place> running the
            police department, visited Monsignor Dineen en masse for an
            explanation. He said the presence of four children at the meeting
            was sufficient reason for police action.</p>
        <p>It was pointed out to him that the four “children” he had spied were
            students of Professor <person reg="Moley, Raymond">Raymond
                Moley</person>'s sociology class at <org>Columbia
                University</org>. They were adults sporting the popular new
            “bobbed hair.”</p>
        <p>We had the hierarchy to thank for so publicizing our meeting that the
            second held shortly after, at the big <org>Park Theatre</org> in
            Columbus Circle was packed fifteen minutes after a single door was
            opened. Two thousand people, many of whom had never heard of birth
            control before Cardinal Hayes gave it nation-wide publicity, stood
            outside clamoring to get in, even climbing up the fire escapes.
            Orators were haranguing from soapboxes, men were pounding each other
            with their fists. <org>Paulist fathers</org> sold anti-birth control
            pamphlets.</p>
        <p>The press kept the birth control publicity alive for weeks, the
                <title>New York Times</title> going so far as to headline the
            fact that Archbishop Hayes had closed the meeting. The most
            conservative papers were placed in the trying situation of defending
            birth control advocates or endorsing a violation of the principle of
            free speech, which “<q who="UNK">must always find defenders if
                democracy is to survive</q>.”</p>
        <p>The hierarchy had turned a simple unheralded meeting into a cause
            celebre, giving our movement more publicity than it could have
            acquired in years of proceeding simply and scientifically on its way
            impeded.</p>
        <p>Eight years later in 1929, church officials again created nationwide
            publicity by their high-handed procedure in ordering a raid of the
                <org>Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</org> in <place
                reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>. Not only supplies but
            confidential records as well were seized. This invasion of the
            highly confidential relation between doctor and patient aroused a
            storm of protest, resulting in strong support from the medical
            profession and community leaders. I will never forget that morning
            of April 15th. I had been up all night with my older son <person
                reg="Sanger, Stuart">Stuart</person>, who was suffering with
            mastoiditus, his temperature running very high. My Secretary,
                <person reg="Lifshiz, Anna">Anna Lifshiz</person>, telephoned
            and said, “<q who="LIFAN">The police are here at the
            clinic.</q>”</p>
        <p>For four years we had been giving help to poverty-stricken women,
            women broken in health, averting families tragedies by teaching
            distracted parents of many children how to space their babies. We
            were beginning to take heart; to believe that word of the good we
            were doing had spread in the neighborhood and outweighed the
            prejudices against us.</p>
        <p>I hurried to West Fifteenth street. The shade to the glass door was
            pulled down; the door locked. I was let in by the plain-clothes man
            from the Vice Squad, and found detectives hurrying around in
            terrific confusion. Dr. <person reg="Pissoort, Elizabeth">Elizabeth
                Pissoort</person> was outraged at the high-handedness of the
            raid; Dr. <person reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer">Hannah Stone</person>
            was equally furious but very aloof, although this was her first
            arrest. “<q who="STOHA">Isn't it fantastic</q>,” she remarked. “<q
                who="STOHA">Only a few minutes ago a visiting physician from the
                Middle West asked one of the nurses whether we ever had any
                police interference, and the nurse told her, ‘Oh no, those days
                are over!</q>”</p>
        <p>Mrs. <person reg="Sullivan, Mary">Mary Sullivan</person>, head of the
                <org reg="New York City Policewomen's Bureau">City Policewomen's
                Bureau</org>, was superintending the raid in person. But
            Patrolwoman Anna McNamara took a far more active part, consulting a
            list in her hand, turning over the case histories in the files as
            swiftly as her fingers could move. Many of these contained the
            personal confessions of women, some of whom had entrusted us with
            knowledge that their husbands had venereal diseases or were insane.
            Not even the nurses had been allowed to see them. Now they were the
            common property of the police department, to be used by them in
            whatever manner they desired.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McNamara taunted me when I told her she had no right to touch
            private medical files. She had come to the clinic some time before
            for contraceptive advice, using the name Mrs. <person
                reg="McNamera, Anna">Tierney</person>, and had received it after
            examination by two physicians, who found her suffering from
            rectocele, cystocele, prolapsus of the uterus, erosions, and
            retroversion.</p>
        <p>I shall never forget the color of Mrs. McNamara's face when she heard
            this medical testimony recited several days later in Magistrates’
            Court at the hearing. She was totally unprepared for this
            embarrassing revelation of her own organs. Months later she returned
            quietly to Dr. Stone to inquire if these findings were true and as
            serious as they sounded.</p>
        <p>A month after that dramatic hearing, the defendants were discharged.
            Again public indignation had been aroused at the high-handed methods
            used against us. Police Commissioner <person reg="Whalen, Grover A."
                >Grover A. Whalen</person>, still trying at that time to ferret
            out <person reg="Rothstein, Arnold">Arnold Rothstein</person>'s
            murder, had termed the raid a “<q who="WHAGR">routine matter</q>”,
            until Dr. <person reg="Williams, Linsley">Linsley Williams</person>,
            Director of the <org reg="New York Academy of Medicine">Academy of
                Medicine</org>, wrote a letter of protest. Then he apologized.
            Mary Sullivan was temporarily demoted.</p>
        <p>I was curious about what had caused the raid in the first place, and
            employed the <org>Burns Detective Agency</org> to sift the affair.
            Approximately fifty percent of our cases were being sent by social
            workers on the lower East and West Sides, a conglomerate of all
            peoples and classes, including Irish, Italians, and other Catholics.
            So many had benefitted and told their neighbors that others also
            were asking of their agencies how to get to our clinic. Catholic
            social workers, at a monthly meeting with officials of the Church,
            had sought guidance in replying to parishioners, and the
            ecclesiastics had been shocked to find that a clinic existed.
            Catholic policewoman had been summoned, Mary Sullivan had been
            chosen to wipe out the Clinical Research Bureau and Mrs. McNamara
            selected for the decoy.</p>
        <p>Again the raid was a tactical error by the opposition. Doctors,
            throughout the land, the world in fact, are highly sensitive about
            the sanctity of case records. On this issue they were firmly united
            in protest, no matter what they thought individually about birth
            control. Our calendars at the reopened clinic were filled three
            weeks in advance. None of our records was ever returned, but Roman
            Catholic patients whose cards had been seized reported that they
            received anonymous threats by telephone that if they continued to go
            to the clinic their private lives would be exposed.</p>
        <p>The <org>Magistrates Court</org> hearings and final decision in our favor was
            front page news in all the papers, the publicity continued for many
            months as it had in the previous case.</p>
        <p>These are but two of the many dramatic episodes in the “fight” for
            birth control. It's still going on. Many important battles have been
            won, medical, legislative, but there is still so much to be
            accomplished.</p>
        <p>On the credit side, instead of a single clinic fighting for its life,
            there are now more than 800 throughout the country. Women who need
            knowledge of child spacing can find it in every state save those
            strongholds of the Catholic hierarchy, <place>Massachusetts</place>
            and <place>Connecticut</place>. But while outmoded laws have been
            invoked to close the clinics in these states, the South so
            frequently scorned as “backward,” has begun the move to place child
            spacing where it logically belongs, with its public health programs
            for maternal care. <place>North Carolina</place> was the first state
            to realize that something had to be done to lower tragically high
            infant and maternal death rates. <place>Mississippi</place> is the
            eighth state to fall in line and give state aid in family planning
            to those mothers who need it most since they cannot afford the
            services of private doctors.</p>
        <p>Another change has taken place. In a <title>Fortune</title> magazine
            poll of 1943, of women between 20 and 35 years, 84.9 approved of
            planned parenthood. Of the Roman Catholic women polled at this time,
            69% encouraged by the anonymity of the poll registered approval. The
            clinics everywhere have as always a large Catholic registration. But
            more than that the church, cornered and moved by the obvious need
            and desire of its own members for some means of family planning, had
            to set its seal of approval on the “Rhythm Method,” that complicated
            and often inaccurate means of discovering a woman’ short cycle of
            fertility. By avoiding intercourse during this period she hopes to
            prevent the birth of children. So the church has approved the idea
            if not the actual methods which medical science endorse for family
            planning.</p>
        <p>Birth Control, the medical means by which planned parenthood may be
            achieved, emphasizes what those close to it always considered its
            greatest aim; the planning of healthy babies. In the planned
            parenthood movement, added stress is being placed on the
            encouragement of those physically and economically able, to have
            more babies. Aid is being extended increasingly to that estimated
            one family in ten of the population which suffers from infertility.
            More and more planned parenthood centers now provide treatment for
            childless couples or refer them to specialists able to help them.
            The <org reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned
                Parenthood Federation</org> at 501 Madison Avenue, New York City
            lists in its directory, along with birth control services, the small
            but growing number of fertility clinics throughout the country. As a
            guide to the unhappy couples who have been unsuccessful in having a
            child the Federation offers in its literature a new pamphlet
                “<title>To Those Denied a Child.</title>”</p>
        <p>It is an interesting fact that more than a third of those couples
            seeking cures for infertility are rewarded by having babies of their
            own, and that people who want children are gaining the confidence to
            seek expert assistance. The male partner for many years scorned the
            idea he might be responsible for his wife's inability to reproduce.
            Sterility to him wrongly implied impotency. Now with men showing as
            great an eagerness for perpetuating themselves as women always have,
            it has been found that the man is responsible in about one third of
            the cases.</p>
        <p>Governments throughout the world are increasingly conscious of social
            engineering, alarmed at imbalances in the birth rate, with the
            poorest families, in each land, those most handicapped in economic
            resources, health and education, carrying the major burden of
            bearing and rearing more than their proportion of the next
            generation's children. This is one of the many problems planned
            parenthood will have to help solve in our war-torn world.</p>
        <p>There are so many things I might have said to my little high school
            friend who believed I could rest now with the “<q who="UNK">fight
                for birth control won</q>”. Does she realize what a long way we
            have come merely in the acceptance of the subject as a legitimate
            health topic? Such a short time ago no “lad” discussed birth
            control; it belonged with the other sex taboos of the age, which I
            feel sure we birth control pioneers helped to dissipate. When I feel
            gratified by our successes I remember that the struggle will never
            be won until every mother in this land and in the world has the
            democratic right to plan her children for that time when her
            physical strength and economic resources will give them the best
            chance for survival. The fight will not be won until we have brought
            this health measure out of the category “obscene”, until censorship
            is no longer the whim of postal clerks who can keep vital
            information from the mails. The latest move in these days when
            marriage counseling is sorely needed has been the ban of Dr. <person
                reg="Stone, Abraham">Abraham</person> and Hannah Stone's
            excellent “<title>Marriage Manual</title>,” long a best seller, from
            sale in mail order catalogues.</p>
        <p>We must make every effort to unshackle medicine from church
            domination. After a long and persistent struggle we have severed the
            state from this domination, <add>but</add> unfortunately we find
            that the Catholic church can still dictate in essential matters of
            health. It is time the weight of public opinion convinced government
            health agencies that the problems of reproduction should be treated
            as purely medical problems. When this happens every state will
            follow the lead of those eight southern states who have added child
            spacing to their public health programs.</p>
        <p>We pioneers cannot completely relax and sign with satisfaction, until
            planned parenthood, has ceased to be a cause, for which one has to
            fight, and become an accepted right of women throughout the world.
            Then and only then can we relax and say, “The battle is won.”</p>
