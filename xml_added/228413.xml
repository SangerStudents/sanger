        <head>WHY BE AFRAID OF MARRIAGE</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p>Every young man and woman who get married establish a new unit in our democracy. For each
            such unit, as for the nation which is made up of all 35,000,000 of them, the only thing
            to fear is fear itself. Yet in all too many of our families, an unwholesomely pervading
            terror lurks. It poisons the relations between husband and wife, between parents and
            children. It is the fear of an unwanted pregnancy. </p>
        <p>Very often these fears are by no means baseless. The state of a mother's health make
            another pregnancy a dangerous, even a fatal adventure. Either or both parents may be
            suffering from an ailment which could be transmitted to the new child or would weaken
            his chances of life and strength. The couple may already have as many children as they
            can provide for adequately, so that another baby would handicap its brothers as well as
            itself. The couple may be poorly prepared educationally for the responsibilities of
            parenthood, since the rearing of human children requires more than animal instinct. </p>
        <p>In all of these cases, any rational mind would conclude that the couple should not at
            this time conceive a new life. </p>
        <p>But fear of pregnancy is not confined to these women, and failure to remove it lies at
            the root of the most frequently cited cause for family unhappiness, recriminations and
            divorce. Many studies show that sexual maladjustments are the chief reasons for broken
            homes, and fear of pregnancy can cause the most serious maladjustments. </p>
        <p>The couple themselves often are not aware of the basis of their discord. The wife's
            fears, which lead to complete disharmony in what should be the most perfect expression
            of their union, becomes more noticeable to them in the form of nagging, constant
            fault-finding, neurotic outbursts. At the <org>Margaret Sanger Research Bureau</org> in
                <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>, where Dr. <person reg="Stone, Abraham"
                >Abraham Stone</person> and Dr. <person reg="Levine, Lena">Lena Levine</person> have
            been conducting a group therapy clinic for just such couples, the damage caused by fears
            of a pregnancy for which the couple is not prepared is plainly seen.</p>
        <p>One <person reg="unidentified">wife</person> at this clinic explained that her attitude
            toward sex had been built up by her mother and her sister so that she was totally
            unprepared for the realities of marriage. </p>
        <p>“<q who="UNK">When you've heard 'it's not nice, it's not nice' all your life, you
                discover that the marriage service itself doesn't change a negative attitude to a
                positive one</q>,” she said. </p>
        <p>No one knows just how greatly fear of an unplanned conception contributes to the
            frightfully large number of abortions performed every year in this country. The
            atmosphere of shame and guilt and illegality prevents any adequate studies of one of our
            most important problems, but it is estimated that one out of every four or five
            pregnancies in the country ends in an illegal abortion. This means something approaching
            a million a year, and the most competent authorities believe that 90 per cent of them
            are performed on married women. </p>
        <p>It is axiomatic that the couple who plan for their children, who want them, do not end
            pregnancies in this desperate manner. </p>
        <p>The late Dr. <person reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer">Hannah Stone</person> once made a study of
            wives who came to the <org reg="Newark Maternal Health Center">Maternal Health
                Center</org> in <place reg="Newark, NJ">Newark</place>, <place>New Jersey</place>.
            Out of 71 women, 51 had anxiety neuroses of one sort or another, and the underlying
            cause was an intense fear of pregnancy. It was found that the husbands of some of these
            women were also neurotic, the reason being the use of unsafe and unsatisfactory methods
            of contraception in an effort to calm the wife's fears. </p>
        <p>Dr. <person reg="Dunbar, Helen Flanders">Flanders Dunbar</person>, in her book
                “<title>Psychosomatic Diagnosis</title>,” tells the story of a young <person
                reg="unidentified">woman</person> whose cause is all the more significantly outlined
            because it is cited as an example of how disease follows anxiety rather than as a
            marital problem. </p>
        <p>The girl had been greatly shocked by the death of her father when she was 16, and at 18
            she married a man ten years older who had long been a friend of the family. Obviously
            she was seeking a replacement for the father in her emotional life. </p>
        <p>Under these circumstances, she was very much frightened at the idea of having a child. By
            the time she was 27 she had developed a very serious heart condition which prevented her
            from doing her housework or even walking a few blocks. Yet, Dr. Dunbar found, there had
            to be one of two other factors than exertion present to bring on one of the young
            woman's attacks. She got them only if she was waiting for her husband to come home at
            night or if she saw a pregnant woman. </p>
        <p>To the psychiatrist, the neurotic fear of pregnancy was plain, although the patient
            rationalized her attitude by saying that she and her husband could not afford to have
            children. After some ten months, this wife achieved almost complete recovery. Part of it
            was the understanding which she achieved of her own state of mind. A year later she came
            back to the doctors to ask if it would be all right for her to have a baby. </p>
        <p>“<q who="UNK">It's funny</q>,” Dr. Dunbar quotes her as saying, “<q who="UNK">I want one
                now when we have less money than we had before, and then I thought we couldn't have
                once because of lack of money</q>.”</p>
        <p>From the purely physiological point of view, the physician comments, this woman's
            pregnancy should have increased the symptoms of heart disease, but it did not and she
            was in due course the mother of a son. It is obvious that for both the parents and the
            child, it was a fortunate circumstance that he was born after his mother had overcome
            her terrors. </p>
        <p>The obvious methods for wiping out needless fears of unplanned pregnancies are adequate
            education of young people before marriage, and adequate contraceptive services
            afterward. Neither are sufficiently prevalent as yet. </p>
        <p>Education, the first point, gets a good deal more lip service than actual support. Yet
            there is ample evidence that it pays. <place reg="Pittsburgh, PA"> Pittsburgh</place>,
            for example, installed a system of sex education for high school students, the classes
            being conducted by both physicians and educators. In two or three years, the leaders in
            the <org reg="Pennsylvania Board of Education">Board of Education</org> reported, the
            rate of pregnancies among girls in the public and parochial schools had been cut in
            half. the same knowledge which brought about this result is making those girls more
            understanding, less terrified wives and better mothers for the children they will bear
            in their maturity. </p>
        <p>In recent years, the medical profession has made as great strides in its understanding of
            contraception as it has in its understanding of disease. Thirty years ago, a great many
            physicians scoffed at or deplored birth control. Today more than 96% of them, according
            to the most recent detailed survey, approve. Furthermore, so grave and authoritative a
            body as the <org reg="New York Academy of Medicine, Council">Council of the New York
                Academy of Medicine</org> has adopted recommendations which urge physicians to take
            the lead in establishing contraceptive clinics in hospitals and improving the quality of
            contraceptive advice given in private practice. </p>
        <p>Physicians have joined the best leadership of the whole community -- educators, social
            workers, clergymen, business and professional leaders -- in recognizing that in the
            complexity of our civilization, family life has been exposed to some hazards which did
            not exist in a simpler stage of human development. To these unavoidable difficulties,
            Dr. <person reg="Menninger, Karl">Karl Menninger</person> has sad, “<q who="MENKA">there
                should certainly not be added the artificial barrier of ignorance</q>.” And he
            added:</p>
        <p>“<q who="MENKA">For this reason, contraceptive knowledge should assuredly be in the
                possession of every adult...For ignorance, for lack of knowledge, for lack of
                facilities and counsel, there is in this enlightened century no excuse
            whatever.</q>”</p>
        <p><org reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned Parenthood</org> is the
            expression of that enlightenment. It brings to the whole family the essential quality
            which removes the fear of pregnancy. It means to the whole family emotional security and
            love for and between parents and children. </p>
