        <head><emph rend="underline">Message from <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret
                    Sanger</person></emph></head>
        <p>I have been honored with the invitation to send a message to women over your station and
            I feel the most timely message at this time would be to those millions of women who are
            deeply involved in this war. You are being asked to take the place of men in industry,
            even to join the <org reg="United States Army">army</org>, <org reg="United States Navy"
                >navy</org>, and <org reg="United States Air Force">air corps</org>. You will be, in
            increasing numbers, doing a man’s work in this war. Yet you are also expected to bear
            and raise the nation’s children, her future citizens. Throughout the country the
            question has been a burning issue, “Shall the war bride have a baby now, or shall she
            wait until the more settled conditions of peace time after the war?”</p>
        <p>Present rising birth rates show that many of you are making the decision of having babies
            now, of perpetuating the man you love. For those of you who are physically, emotionally
            and economically able to undertake this added a burden under present conditions, I say
            go ahead, more power to you. But consider wisely these facts, ask yourself these serious
            questions.</p>
        <p>Will I be able to support this child in the event my husband does not return? Or if her
            should return a helpless invalid or cripple?</p>
        <p>Will my child suffer in the event of a prolonged war and the severe rationing of food, as
            a children in <place>Europe</place> are suffering?</p>
        <p>Will my anxiety for the return of my husband affect the child after he is born -- even
            before he is born?</p>
        <p>Is my own health, my emotional stability, equal to the strain of making it possible for
            me to bear a healthy normal child under present conditions?</p>
        <p>Most of all, is it fair to deprive my child of his father during his early years, perhaps
            for all his life?</p>
        <p>It is difficult to give these matters reasoned consideration during troubled emotional
            times such as these, when the instinct of a woman is to perpetuate the one she loves and
            may lose, but it is unfair to the child, to herself, to society, if she lets her
            emotions over-rule her reasoned considerations.</p>
        <p>There is no danger of race-suicide in <place reg="United States">America</place>; our
            birth-rate is the highest in our history and rising steadily. Our national concern now
            should be for quality, for healthier babies and mothers, fewer infant and maternal
            mortalities, fewer social misfits who should never have been born and are a rising
            burden on society.</p>
        <p>Stories come from all over the nation of incredibly crowded conditions in maternity
            hospitals, babies being delivered in doctors’ offices, in trailers, mothers sent home
            from hospitals with their infants immediately after delivery. Conditions such as these
            are bound to affect the mortality statistics of mothers and new born babies. Consider
            these things; consider the fact that many more millions of you will be needed in
            industry before this war is won, before you rashly and emotionally succumb to an
            instinct to bear a war baby. You chances for happiness may be much greater in many cases
            if both you and your husband wait until the grim business of war is over, and times are
            more nearly normal again.</p>
