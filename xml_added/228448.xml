        <head>Long distance call to Mrs. Edna McKinnon-</head>
        <p>Message for Annual meeting-Chicago-</p>
        <p> Please convey my congratulations to the Chicago Planned Parenthood Association on the
            splendid work accomplished. Greater horizons and greater efforts will be presented to
            your group by Dr. <person reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer">Stone</person>. The entire world,
            and in particular <place>Asia</place>, looks to us to lead them toward a planned
            population on the road to International peace.</p>
        <p>Your loyal supporters have helped us endure the struggles, discouragements and kept the
            movement advancing against religious intolerance and dogmas. More than forty-three
            countries throughout the world now have inspiring groups ready to work provided they
            have films, literature, translations. The movement has been maintained through tincup
            contributions, comparatively pennies. Today the world movement demands larger concepts,
            and efforts. We must now think in terms of millions if we would help maintain a balanced
            world population and ultimately world peace.</p>
