        <head>Women and Birth Control</head>
        <byline>BY <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET SANGER</person></byline>
        <p>I was one of eleven children. My <person reg="Higgins, Anna Purcell">mother</person> died
            in her forties. My <person reg="Higgins, Michael Hennessey">father</person> enjoyed life
            until his eighties. Seven of my brothers and sisters are still living. If I am not an
            "old-fashioned" woman, at least I was an old-fashioned child. I have never thought it
            necessary to call public attention to these circumstances of my life. Not that I ashamed
            of them, but, on the other hand, neither am I brazenly proud of them. I do not believe
            that these facts are sufficient as a foundation upon which to erect a code of moral for
            all men and women of the future to follow. I do not say: "My mother gave birth to eleven
            living children, seven of whom are still alive and more or less healthy. Ergo, all women
            should give birth to eleven or a dozen children." There are, it seems to me, a few other
            things to consider.</p>
        <p>I have been impelled to cast aside my habitual reticence because I have just finished
            reading a highly personal essay in the March number of <title type="journal">THE NORTH
                AMERICAN REVIEW</title>, written by a lady known as <person reg="Wells, Marjorie"
                >Marjorie Wells</person>. Mrs. Wells confesses herself the mother of ten children.
            Her family stretches "<q who="WELMA">already as far as the eye can reach and with the
                end not yet in sight.</q>" This biological fact seems to endow Mrs. Wells with the
            glib authority to hand down decisions concerning complex problems which have puzzled
            humanity since civilization first began. I rejoice with Marjorie Wells in the peace and
            happiness she has found in her "monumental" family. But I confess that I am not
            convinced that feminine wisdom increases in direct proportion with the number of one's
            offspring.</p>
        <p>Implicit in Marjorie Wells's confession I discover a certain condescension toward the
            mothers of smaller families. She knows all there is to know about keeping the stork from
            the door. She admits her vastly superior knowledge of practical biology. She has read my
            book <title type="book">Motherhood in Bondage</title>, which is a compilation of case
            records in marital misery, of protests from slave mothers against the blind inhumanity
            of natural law. From the citadel of her self-satisfaction, Marjorie Wells asserts that
            my theories have become badly scrambled with my emotions and that I attempt to be "<q
                who="WELMA">both scientific and sympathetic at the same time</q>"--as though that
            were quite impossible! I have made, according to Mrs. Wells, "<q who="WELMA">the usual
                mistake of women who attempt the guidance of public opinion, and try to transfer to
                public responsibility what is essentially and inevitably a private and local
                problem.</q>"</p>
        <p>Intellectually speaking, she "high-hats" me. A mere woman who has borne only three
            children instead of ten, who can therefore never hope to reach that peak of serene
            Olympian indifference to the cries and moans of my less fortunate sisters which Marjorie
            Wells has attained, I cannot hope to equal in dialectic skill a lady who has enjoyed the
            educational advantage of ten pregnancies. I have not yet attained that point of
            self-confidence which enables me to cast aside as irrelevant and unimportant the
            conclusions of scientists who have devoted their lives to the study of genetics, nor can
            I close my eyes to the statistics of Government workers who have made deep researches
            into the conditions productive of the alarming maternity death rate in these
                <place>United States</place>. Having been only one of eleven hungry little brothers
            and sisters, I was not able to profit by the early educational advantages which Marjorie
            Wells evidently enjoyed. Her philosophic poise enables her to look upon the birth of a
            child as <q who="WELMA">"a purely private and local problem.</q>" I have always assumed,
            and I do not believe that I am egregious in this assumption, that the birth of a child
            is an event of the utmost importance not only to the family into which it is born, but
            to the community, to the nation, to the whole future of the human race. I agree with
                <person reg="Hoover, Herbert">President Hoover</person>.<q who="HOOHE"> The ideal to
                which we should strive is that there shall be no child in America: That has not been
                born under proper conditions; that does not live in hygienic surroundings; that ever
                suffers from under-nourishment; that does not have prompt and efficient medical
                attention and inspection; that does not receive primary instruction in the elements
                of hygiene and good health; that has not the complete birthright of a sound mind and
                a sound body; that has not the encouragement to express in fullest measure the
                spirit within which is the final endowment of every human being.</q></p>
        <p>I suppose those of us who subscribe to these ideas are in the eyes of Marjorie Wells
            hopeless sentimentalists.</p>
        <p>My opponent sharply crystallizes a definite point of view not only concerning the theory
            and the practice of Birth Control, but toward all the social problems which confront us
            today. Hers is the attitude of "splendid isolation," of enlightened self-interest, of
                <foreign lang="FRE" rend="italics">laissez-faire</foreign>. She tells us in effect
            that she is the mother of ten healthy children, that she and her husband enjoy from them
            a daily dividend of satisfaction and delight, and that therefore she "<q who="WELMA"
                >should worry</q>" about the behavior and condition of the less fortunate. "Am I my
            sister's keeper?" asks in effect Marjorie Wells.</p>
        <p>It is late in the day to point out that all human experience teaches that an attitude of
            "splendid isolation" can no longer be logically maintained by any individual in the face
            of the problems which confront American civilization. If only from the motive of
            self-protection the well-born and the well-bred can no longer shirk responsibility
            concerning <q who="WELMA">"the behavior and the condition of the unfortunates.</q>"</p>
        <p>Time after time, it has been demonstrated in all the countries of Western civilization,
            that as we descend the social scale the birth-rate increases. Dependent, delinquent and
            defective classes all tend to become more prolific than the average normal and
            self-dependent stratum of society. With this high birth rate is correlated a high infant
            mortality rate. This law is true in all countries. More children are born; more babies
            die. So likewise, the maternal mortality rate jumps correspondingly. Out of the
            surviving infants are recruited the morons, the feeble-minded, the dependents, who make
            organized charities a necessity, and who later fill prisons, penitentiaries and State
            homes. To compute the cost in dollars and cents of these industriously prolific classes
            to society is beyond human power. Every one of us pays for their support and
            maintenance. Funds which legitimately should go to pure scientific research, to aid the
            fine fruition of American civilization, are thus diverted to the support of those
            who--in all charity and compassion--should never have been born at all.</p>
        <p>We cannot ignore, as Marjorie Wells confesses she does, "<q who="WELMA">such charming
                contingencies as inherited lunacy, disease and abject poverty.</q>" They press in
            upon us on all sides. These things, she says, do not belong in her personal problem. I
            beg to remind her that they do. For, despite her valiant efforts to bring up her own
            brood, Mrs. Wells will, in time, find out, if she has not already found out, that the
            children of the defective and the diseased will crowd into the schoolroom with her own
            children, and that standards of intelligence must perforce be lowered to meet their
            limited capacities. The community in which she lives will call upon her to aid the
            alleviation of the poverty and distress of the all too prolific. Her property and income
            will be taxed to maintain State institutions for the support of the dependent and the
            delinquent. She will resent bitterly this enforced expenditure of funds that should go
            for the higher education and the cultural development of her talented children. That is,
            if her resources are as limited as she admits them to be. And finally she will discover
            that her own good luck in life is not the general rule, but a fortunate exception, upon
            which it would be the utmost folly to attempt to generalize concerning this exceedingly
            human race.</p>
        <p>"But", she may now retort, "you are speaking dogmatically, making a special plea for
            public approval of the dissemination of Birth Control." Marjorie Wells is convinced that
            the cases recorded in my book <title type="book">Motherhood in Bondage</title> are
            abnormalities and horrors, gathered together merely to foist the practice of
            contraception upon unwilling parents.</p>
        <p>Let us turn, then, to less prejudiced and partisan sources. Let us consider the findings
            of impartial investigators who have no interest in what our critics call propaganda. Let
            us find out, if we can, the truth concerning the conditions under which children are
            brought into our American world. For this evidence we need not go far afield. In a
            recent report published in <title type="journal">The Survey</title>, <person
                reg="Corbin, Hazel">Hazel Corbin</person>, R.N., general director of the
                <org>Maternity Center Association of <place>New York</place></org>, states that year
            after year, more than twenty thousand women die from causes due to childbirth--one
            mother for every one hundred and fifty babies born! The <person
                reg="Newton, Walter Hughes">Newton</person> bill had as its aim Government
            responsibility for the health of American citizens including the special needs of the
            mothers of the country. This bill died when the last <org reg="United State Congress"
                >Congress</org> expired. The <person reg="Sheppard, Morris"
                >Sheppard</person>-<person reg="Towner, Horace">Towner</person> Act expires June 30,
            1929; and unless Congress provides a further Federal subsidy, the Government aid for
            mothers and children which its funds have furthered during the last six years will be
            brought to a close.</p>
        <p>When correlated with the refusal of State legislatures to consider bills which would make
            Birth Control education permissive, these facts assume new significance. Our Government
            pronounces itself unwilling to assume responsibility in alleviating the hazardous trade
            of maternity. At the same time the State and Federal authorities refuse to countenance
            legislation which would allow American mothers to help themselves--which would permit
            them to choose the time and the conditions best suited for the fulfillment of the
            maternal function.</p>
        <p>"<q who="CORHA">The birth of a baby is such a common, every-day occurrence,</q>" writes
            Hazel Corbin, "<q who="CORHA">that people do not realize that during pregnancy the
                margin between health and disease becomes dangerously narrow, and only by skilled
                medical supervision can the maintenance of health be assured. Every mother in the
                country needs skilled medical supervision, nursing care and instruction during
                pregnancy, at delivery, and for the six weeks that follow. Many families do not know
                of this need. Not all families can provide this care. It is not available at any
                price in many parts of this rich country. There are no doctors, nurses and midwives
                properly trained to give adequate care to all mothers.</q>"</p>
        <p>Yet two million women in America are compelled, by law, to descend annually into the
            valley of the shadow of death, to bear two million children in a country that has
            enacted drastic immigration restriction laws to prevent over-population. No: we are not
            under-populated--there is no need for a "full speed ahead" policy of procreation. Since
            the revelations of <title type="book">Motherhood in Bondage</title> are condemned as
            exceptional, let us listen further to the testimony of Hazel Corbin: "<q who="CORHA"
                >There are, caring for our mothers, midwives so ignorant and superstitious as to
                suppose hemorrhage can be controlled by placing an axe upside down under the
                patient's bed. Of about fifty thousand practicing midwives only a small portion are
                well-trained and the majority are untrained--yet in most instances they are licensed
                or registered by their States.</q>"</p>
        <p>Let us turn to the testimony of <person reg="Lathrop, Julia">Julia Lathrop</person>,
            ex-chief of the <org reg="United States Children's Bureau">Children's Bureau</org>,
            under whose supervision Government agents made extensive investigations surrounding
            infant mortality in eight typical cities of our country. Infant mortality rates concern
            all children who die during the first five years of life. On the whole, according to
            Miss Lathrop in <title type="journal">The Woman's Journal</title>, the evidence is
            overwhelming that poverty, ignorance, or both, lack of medical and nursing care,
            unwholesome living conditions, overworked mothers, remoteness from doctors and nurses in
            rural areas, and other types of inability to give babies needed care are in marked
            degree coincident with high infant morality rates. A vast number of babies and of
            mothers die needlessly every year in this country. This fact is well-known to
            statisticians, doctors and to some social workers, but details as to social and economic
            conditions under which the parents live are seldom disclosed or frankly discussed.</p>
        <p>Today the situation remains fundamentally unnoticed. Women clamor for deliverance from
            compulsory motherhood. Yet dull-witted legislators, both State and Federal, refuse to
            sanction the dissemination of harmless contraceptives to those unable or unwilling, due
            to the conditions discovered by Government agents, to undergo a pregnancy that may be
            fatal to mother or child. Yet measures aiming to improve by Governmental agencies
            dysgenic conditions surrounding maternity and infancy are condemned and defeated as
            "paternalistic." The situation calls for a <person reg="Shaw, George Bernard"
                >Shaw</person> or a <person reg="Swift, Jonathan">Swift</person>.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this dilemma has been created not so much by the laws and the legislators
            themselves as by the smug and bland indifference of women themselves--of those
            fortunate, well-bred, well-educated women who refuse to concern themselves with the
            sordid tragedies of those they consider their social inferiors.</p>
        <p>Whether Birth Control is right or wrong, moral or immoral, a need or a nuisance, one
            thing is certain. Mothers of ten or of one can no longer, by the mere exercise of a
            function common to all living creatures consider themselves exempt from social
            responsibility. As Miss Lathrop has expressed it: "<q who="LATJU">One thing is in my
                opinion certain--only mothers can save this cooperative work for maternity and
                infancy. If prosperous, intelligent mothers do not urge the protection of the lives
                of all mothers and babies, why should we expect Congress to come unasked to their
                aid?</q>"</p>
        <p>Though Julia Lathrop is here making a plea only for Government protection of maternity
            and infancy, the same truth is applicable to the doctrine of Birth Control. The most
            stubborn opposition to Birth Control has come, not from the moralists nor the
            theologians, the most distinguished of whom recognize its legitimate necessity, but from
            those women who, like Marjorie Wells, "<q who="WELMA">know as much about keeping the
                stork from the door as my most friendly and unfriendly critics,</q>" yet
            nevertheless assume that such knowledge, simple, harmless and hygienic as it is, must be
            kept for the privileged few and from the very women most in need of it. Such an attitude
            seems to grow out of a frantic feminine desire to retain a certain superiority, social
            or otherwise, over one's less fortunate neighbors.</p>
        <p>Even for that very limited and very special type of woman who is gifted by nature and
            natural inclination--and also by wealth--to undertake a specialized career in maternity
            and to become the mother of ten or a dozen children, there is need for the practice of
            Birth Control. For if she be intelligent and farseeing, such a woman will recognize the
            necessity of "spacing" her children, of recuperating her full physical strength and
            psychic well-being after the birth of one child before undertaking the conception of
            another. Mothers of large families have written me expressing their gratitude for the
            benefits of Birth Control. It has enabled them to give each of their children a good
            start in life. It has prevented crowding, and has moreover permitted them to enjoy
            marital communion which would otherwise have been impossible. But let us recognize
            today--with the ever-increasing cost of living, and the high cost of childbirth--that
            the large family must more and more be considered the privilege of the moneyed class. A
            large family, if the income is small, is a crime against the children born into it. I
            was one of eleven, and I believe that I am slightly more entitled to speak on this
            subject than Marjorie Wells, who is, after all, only the mother of ten! I may be
            prejudiced, but I feel that the testimony of a child born into a large family is of more
            interest and importance than that of the mere progenitor of a large family. It all
            depends on the point of view!</p>
        <p>American civilization has long passed the pioneer stage of its development. We no longer
            have a vast continent to populate. We no longer need mere numbers. But we are only
            beginning to realize that there are other values in life than those of mere quantity. We
            have not yet outgrown the adolescent habit of worshiping the biggest this, the largest
            that, the most of the other thing. So I think, no one need take any excessive pride in
            the production of a large family, even though the rotogravure sections of our Sunday
            newspapers will undoubtedly, for the delight and amusement of their millions of readers,
            continue to publish photographs of large families which imitate visually a long flight
            of steps.</p>
        <p>The attitude of those who have been rewarded by life, and cannot see the punishment
            inflicted upon others reminds me always of <person reg="Pangloss, Dr. (fictional)">Dr.

                "<q who="VOL">It has been proved,</q>" said Dr. Pangloss, "<q who="VOL">that things
                cannot be otherwise than they are; for, everything being made for a certain end, the
                end for which everything is made is necessarily the best end.</q>" And though the
            world went to wreck and ruin about him, he still maintained that "<q who="VOL">it does
                not become me to retract my words.</q>
            <person reg="von Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm">Leibnitz</person> cannot possibly be
            wrong--the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world. All events are
            inextricably linked together in this best of all possible worlds."</p>
        <p>Rather, I think, in this matter of mothers and children--whether we be the mother of ten,
            or the sister of ten--we must heed the counsel of <person reg="Candide (fictional)"
                >Candide</person> himself and cultivate our garden.</p>
