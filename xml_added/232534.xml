        <head>BIRTH CONTROL OR ABORTION?</head>
        <byline rend="italics">By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p>Family limitation will be practiced. No law has yet been framed that can prevent it. The
            church has been powerless and the champions of wornout moral creeds find themselves
            trying in vain to force all women to become mothers against their wills.</p>
        <p>Abundant evidence of the futility of seeking to impose involuntary motherhood upon women
            is found in the size of the families of the rich, of the well-to-do and of the wage
            workers of larger earning capacity. The women of these classes long ago refused to be
            mere brood animals–-usually they prefer to be voluntary mothers, determining for
            themselves the number of children they shall have and when they shall have them. Family
            limitation for them is an accomplished fact.</p>
        <p>It is also an accomplished fact with many of the wives of the less highly paid workers.
            But with the latter, as well as with some of their more fortunate sisters, family
            limitation takes a far more drastic and too often a terribly dangerous course. The
            awakened woman of today will not bear unwanted children. She will not bear more children
            than she can care for. And if she is denied the knowledge of the safe, harmless,
            scientific methods of Birth Control, she limits her family by means of abortion.</p>
        <p>In the very nature of the case, it is impossible to get accurate figures upon the number
            of abortions performed annually in the <place>United
                States</place>. It is often said, however, that one in five pregnancies end in
            abortion. One estimate is that 150,000 occur in the United States each year and that
            25,000 women die of the effects of such operations in every twelve months. Dr. <person
                reg="Robinson, William J.">William J. Robinson</person> asserts that there are
            1,000,000 abortions every year in this country and adds that the estimate is
            conservative. He quotes Justice <person reg="Clark, John Proctor">John Proctor
                Clark</person> as saying that there are at least 100,000 in the same length of time
            in <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place> alone.</p>
        <p>Dr. <person reg="Hirsch, Max">Max Hirsch</person>, a famous authority quotes an opinion
            that there are 2,000,000 abortions in the United States every year!</p>
        <p>"<q who="HIRMA">I believe</q>" declares Dr. Hirsch, "<q who="HIRMA">that I may say
                without exaggeration that absolutely spontaneous or unprovoked abortions are
                extremely rare, that a vast majority--I should estimate it at 80 per cent--have a
                criminal origin.</q>"</p>
        <p>"<q who="HIRMA">Our examinations have informed us that the largest number of abortions
                are performed on married women. This fact brings us to the conclusion that
                contraceptive measures among the upper classes and the practice of abortion among
                the lower class, are the real means employed to regulate the number of
                offspring.</q>"</p>
        <p>The question, then, is not whether family limitation should be practised. It is being
            practised; it has long been practised and it will always be practised. The question now
            is whether it is to be attained by normal, scientific Birth Control methods or by the
            abnormal, often dangerous, surgical operation.</p>
        <p>That is the question which the church, the state, the moralist and most of all, the woman
            herself, must face.</p>
        <p>The knowledge of Birth Control methods may for a time be denied to the woman of the
            working class, but those who are responsible for denying it to her, and she herself,
            should understand clearly the dangers to which she is exposed by the dark age laws which
            force her into the hands of the abortionist. To understand the more clearly what these
            dangers are, and to realize the more fully how much better it would be to avoid them, it
            is first necessary that women should know something of the processes of conception, the
            prevention of which frees them of all risk of having to resort to abortion.</p>
        <p>In every woman's ovaries there are imbedded millions of ovules or eggs. They are there in
            every female at birth and as the girl grows into womanhood, these ovules or eggs develop
            also. At a certain period or age, the ripest ovule leaves the nest or ovary and comes on
            down one of the tubes into the womb and passes out of the body. When this takes place,
            it is said that the girl is at the age of puberty, for the ovule is now ready for
            fertilization (or conception) by the male sperm.</p>
        <p>About the same time that the ovule is ripening or developing, the womb is preparing to
            receive the fertilized ovum by a reinforced blood supply brought to its lining. To this
            lining the ovum will cling and gather its nourishment after fertilization takes place.
            If fertilization (conception) does not take place, the ovum passes on out of the body
            and the uterus throws off its surplus blood supply. This is called the menstrual period
            and occurs once a month or about every twenty-eight days.</p>
        <p>In the male sexual organs, there are glands (testes) which secrete a fluid called the
            semen. In the semen is the lifegiving principle, the sperm.</p>
        <p>When intercourse takes place (if no preventative is used) the semen is deposited in the
            woman's vagina. The ovule is not in the vagina, but is in the womb, further up, in
            safety, or perhaps in the tube on its way to the womb. As steel is attracted to the
            magnet, the sperm of the male starts on its way to seek the ovum. Several of these sperm
            cells start, but only one enters the ovum and is absorbed into it. This process is
            called fertilization, conception or impregnation. If no children are desired, the
            meeting of the male sperm and the ovum must be prevented. When scientific means are used
            to prevent this meeting, and thereby to limit families, one is said to practise Birth
            Control.</p>
        <p>But if preventive means are not used and the sperm meets the ovum and development thus
            begins, any attempt at removing it or stopping its further growth is called
            abortion.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that women are apt to look upon abortion as of little consequence and
            to treat it accordingly. An abortion is as important a matter as a confinement and
            requires as much attention as the birth of a child at its full term.</p>
        <p>"<q who="EDGJC">The immediate dangers of abortion</q>," says Dr. <person
                reg="Edgar, J. Clifton">J. Clifton Edgar</person>, in his book "<title>The Practice
                of Obstetrics</title>," "<q who="EDGJC">are hemhorrage, retention of an adherent
                placenta, sepsis, tetanus, perforation of the uterus. They also cause sterility,
                anemia, malignant diseases, displacements, neurosis, and endometritis.</q>"</p>
        <p>In plain, everyday language, in an abortion there is always a very serious risk to the
            health and often to the life of the patient.</p>
        <p>It is only the women of wealth who can afford to give an abortion proper care and
            treatment both at the time of the operation and afterwards. These women often escape any
            serious consequences from its occurrence.</p>
        <p>The women whose incomes are limited and who must continue at work before they have
            recovered from the effects of an abortion are the great army of sufferers. It is among
            such that the deaths due to abortion usually ensue. It is these, too, who are most often
            forced to resort to such operations.</p>
        <p>If death does not result, the woman who has undergone an abortion is not therefore safe.
            The womb may not return to its natural size but remain large and heavy, tending to fall
            away from its natural position. Abortion often leaves the uterus in a condition to
            conceive easily again and unless prevention is strictly followed another pregnancy will
            surely occur. Frequent abortions tend to cause barrenness and serious, painful pelvic
            ailments. These and other conditions arising from such operations are quite likely to
            ruin a woman's general health.</p>
        <p>While there are cases where even the law recognizes an abortion as justifiable if
            recommended by a physician, I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions
            performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization.</p>
        <p rend="italics">I also assert that the responsibility for these abortions and the illness,
            misery and deaths that come in their train lies at the door of a government whose
            authority has been stretched beyond the limits of the people's intention and which, in
            its puritanical blindness, insists upon suffering and death from ignorance, rather than
            life and happiness from knowledge and prevention.</p>
        <p rend="italics">It needs no assertion of mine to call attention to the grim fact that the
            laws prohibiting the imparting of information concerning the preventing of conception
            are responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year in this country and an untold
            amount of sickness and sorrow. The suffering and the death of these women is squarely
            upon the heads of the lawmakers and the puritanical, masculine-minded persons, who
            insist upon retaining the abominable legal restrictions.</p>
        <p>Try as they will they cannot escape the truth, nor hide it under the cloak of stupid
            hypocrisy. If the laws against imparting knowledge of scientific Birth Control were
            repealed, the 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 women who undergo abortions in the United States
            each year would escape the agony of the surgeon's instruments and the long trail of
            disease, suffering and death which so often follows.</p>
        <p>"<q who="HIRMA">He who would combat abortion</q>" says Dr. Hirsch, "<q who="HIRMA">and at
                the same time combat contraceptive measures may be likened to the person who would
                fight contagious diseases and forbid disinfection. For contraceptive measures are
                important weapons in the fight against abortion.</q></p>
        <p> "<q who="HIRMA">America has a law since 1873 *** which prohibits by criminal statute,
                the distribution and regulation of contraceptive measures. It follows, therefore ***
                that America stands at the head of all nations in the huge number of
            abortions.</q>"</p>
        <p>There is the case in a nutshell. Family limitation will always be practised as it is now
            being practised–-either by Birth Control or by abortion. We know that. The one means
            health and happiness–-a stronger, better race. The other means disease, suffering,
            death.</p>
        <p>When all is said and done, it is not the advocates of Birth Control, but the bitter,
            unthinkable conditions brought about by the blindness of church, state and society that
            puts up to all three the question: <emph rend="italics">Birth Control or Abortion–-which
                shall it be?</emph></p>
