        <p>In reviewing this subject over the years when the greatest concern
            &amp; convincing argument was to save the mother from the fatal
            result of abortions &amp; too frequent pregnancies. Today the
            subject has taken <del>up</del>
            <add>on</add> wider horizons--worldwide interest of people in all
            lands <del>&amp;</del>
            <add>as well as</add> the resources necessary to feed &amp; clothe
            &amp; supply them with the means <del>of</del> to sustain life &amp;
            the <add>personal</add> development in dignity &amp; freedom.</p>
        <p>It was encouraging <add>to us all</add> that <del>it</del>
            <place reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokyo</place> at the <org
                reg="International Planned Parenthood Federation">IPP</org>. Conference Oct
            24-30/56 the subject of greatest interest in the press &amp; to the
            delegates was discussion of the possibility of the use of a
            contraceptive pill. Dr <person reg="Pincus, Gregory">Gregory
                Pincus</person> of the <org>Worcester Foundation for
                Experimental Biology</org> in his paper pointed out that certain
            hormones can &amp; will inhibit ovulation. He had experimented for
            years with rabbits &amp; rats &amp; of late had successful
            experiences with giving the same hormone <add>via mouth</add> to
            women.</p>
        <p> There were others who did not report the same success, but the
            important fact is that the door so long shut &amp; bolted in
            laboratories is at last partly opened. To give honest skill &amp;
            enthusiasm to this new method of contraception may be the single
            means of changing the quality of the population of the world--and
            truly giving an upward &amp; onward lift to a cultural civilization.
