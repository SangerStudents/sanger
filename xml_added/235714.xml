        <head>Is Motherhood Sacred?</head>
        <p>This is a question that millions of women have flung at me.</p>
        <p>Motherhood gives to woman most of her most beautiful attributes, and Maternity coupled
            with love of the mate exalts Motherhood to a plane.</p>
        <p>The best &amp; rightful environment for a child is that which surrounds a happy healthy
            joyous Mother.</p>
        <p>If Motherhood were free from fears &amp; worries, anxieties free to devote herself only
            to those children she could properly rear &amp; guide, we would have fewer gangsters
            racketeers &amp; criminals.</p>
        <p>The <del>normal</del>
            <add>moral</add> influence of an <add>intelligent</add> mother over her young child is
            far greater for good, than any institutions, <add>juvenile</add> courts, a
                <add>reform</add> schools. If we know this to be true why do we make it necessary or
            possible for <del>no</del> mothers to bring so many children into the world that she
            cannot give them the attention of guidance necessary for their training &amp;
            development consequently they are neglected, pushed out of the home at an early age,
            find streets there only play grounds &amp; evil companions their guides.</p>
        <p>Inevitably they are bound to end up in reform schools.</p>
        <p>A cruel life for children a cruel &amp; unnecessary hardship for the mothers.</p>
        <p>Better a thousand times that such children had not been born--had never seen the light of
            day.</p>
