        <head rend="underline">CIVILIZING POWER OF<title/> PLANNED
            PARENTHOOD</head>
        <byline>Margaret Sanger</byline>
        <p>Many years ago I wrote and published a book entitled “<title>The
                Pivot of Civilization</title>.” The point of this book was that
            the future of civilization is, in all its phases, dependent upon
            Planned Parenthood––or Birth Control, as we expressed the idea of
            contraception in those pioneering days. I was brought to a new
            realization of how swiftly we have moved in these past thirty years.
            Our civilization has wrought miracles on one level, and plunged
            humanity into disaster and chaos on another. Our civilization gives
            evidence of an <emph rend="underline">inner</emph> conflict. It
            suffers from a “split personality”.</p>
        <p>First let us look at the miracles it has wrought. Its scientists and
            engineers have harnessed and controlled the vast forces of external
            nature. Just glance at the vast hydro-electric projects, furnishing
            millions upon millions of horsepower, by converting wild water
            resources into electric power. Think of man’s conquest of the
            implacable law of gravitation, which produced the miracle of
            aviation, by which we all profit. Consider man’s achievement in
            electronics, and the miracles of television and radio
            communications. And finally, the scientists who have explored the
            atom have released upon our world the mysterious resources of atomic
            energy–-with its cast potentials for good–-and for evil!</p>
        <p>But while Mankind--and in the last few decades, mind you--has
            conquered and controlled and tamed the vast heretofore forces of the
            outer universe, we can find only slight success in the control and
            conquest of the inner, subjective drives and passions within human
            nature itself. Blind energies riot uncontrolled through the vast
            human species, populating this little globe! We find ourselves
            confronted not only by WAR--hot and cold!–-but all the other
            appalling consequences of uncontrolled population increase: Whole
            communities of thousands and of millions are uprooted from their
            homes, driven into exile, victims of mass extermination, of
            epidemics, of famine, starvation, despised and rejected; slave labor
            camps replacing the concentration camps; or millions sent to the
            steppes of <place reg="Siberia, Soviet Union">eastern
                Siberia</place> with the command of the Soviet despots to
            populate those barren areas!</p>
        <p>Confronted by these mass tragedies, with their chaos and confusion it
            would be hypocritical to speak of <add>a</add> Civilization in this
            age. But I could not help thinking how much more humane it might be
            if our great scientists had turned away from the invention of
            A-bombs and H-bombs, with their atrocious power of destruction, to
            the more necessary and benign task of producing a reliable,
            efficient, cheaply produced and easily distributed contraceptive.
            The victimized mothers of the world would with one great voice thank
            them as the benefactors of humanity today and all the future. How
            much greater would be this service to Civilization, instead of the
            present unholy alliance between Science and the powers of
            destruction!</p>
        <p>I believe that all of you who have studied the new statistics of
            comparative demography, the discoveries of the new social
            anthropology, the findings of the impartial geneticists, the experts
            in population and over-population, must agree with me that our
            civilization, however great its outer achievements, has failed to
            probe to the root causes of human miseries. Too often it has
            expended its energies in seeking to bridge order out of chaos,
            instead of, with farseeing vision preventing the great human
            catastrophies.</p>
        <p>To my book <title>“The Pivot of Civilization”</title>, my good
            friend, the late <person reg="Wells, H.G.">H. G. Wells</person>
            contributed an introduction in which he contrasted the new
            progressive, experimental ideal of civilization with that of the old
            static, traditional way of life dominated by Mother Church and
            Father State. Mr. Wells surveyed, as a historian, several
            civilizations of the past and present. Today we are living, he
            believed, not in a simple or complete civilization, but in a
            conflict of at least two civilizations. One of these he called the
            Traditional or Authoritative civilization which rests blindly upon
            the customs of past generations. It insists upon respect and
            obedience to the powers that be. It discourages criticism and
            inquiry. It is not only ancient, but conservative and
            reactionary.</p>
        <p>Contrasted with the older civilization we find that Mr. Wells calls
            the <add>new</add> civilization <add>one</add> of inquiry, of
            experiment, knowledge and science. Creative and progressive
            civilization says “<q who="TENAL">Let knowledge grow from more to
                more and more of reverence in us dwell.</q>” “<q who="welGH">Let
                man know and trust him.</q>” These two forces today are at war
            upon a thousand issues. Ancient civilizations all encouraged
            unrestricted breeding to meet the catastrophic waste of life through
            wars, pestilence, floods and periodic epidemics. The new
            civilization has conquered to a large extent the scourges, floods
            and preventible diseases, but confronts us with the explosive
            dangers of an overpopulated world. We find the old civilization
            clamoring for more and more babies-–the cry “Our babies are
            dying,give us more babies.” They will eventually become consumers
            say the Communists. They put all the answers to over-populated
            areas--“Let them emigrate. Let them expand their industry!” Under
            our very eyes, as reported in the newspapers, we can watch the
            Soviets sending to the steppes of Siberia thousands upon thousands
            of young men and women to breed and populate a now barren territory.
            According to a special dispatch to the <title>New York Times</title>
            for <place reg="Moscow, Soviet Union">Moscow</place>:</p>
        <p>“<q who="DANCL">Last year 150,000 young men and women were sent out
                as pioneers to the new lands. This year, according to the
                    <org>Komsomol</org>, Communist youth organization, 620,000
                others volunteered to join the first settlers. The Komsomol has
                chosen 165,000 of whom 55,000 have already gone east. Every few
                days several carloads of migrants leave from the big city
                stations.</q>”</p>
        <p>This example illustrates the authoritarian despotism of the so-called
            Soviet civilization (however much the Soviets may boast of their
            progressiveness). Population policies are decided by Father State,
            or in <person reg="Orwell, George">Orwell</person>’s satire-–“<q
                who="ORWGE">Big Brother knows best!</q>”</p>
        <p>The new civilizing power of Planned Parenthood, in contrast,
            liberates the potential mother and wife from the despotic decrees of
            Father State–-or Mother Church. It restores self-direction,
            self-decision, self-determination of the parents to advance the
            family. Planned Parenthood recognizes the desire on the part of
            husband and wife to build up a healthy, happy family; to recognize
            and accept responsibility of the number of children in the family.
            It envisages education for parenthood before arrival of offspring,
            the spacing of births in consideration of the mother’s health, the
            father’s earning capacity and the standards of living and culture to
            be maintained.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the older, vanishing civilization, which was limited
            and nationalistic in scope, the new civilization assumes world-wide
            responsibilities. This new internationalism is embodied in the
            ideals of the <org>United Nations</org> organization. But as far as
            I have been able to discover, the United Nations and its subsidiary
            bodies have shied away from the basic problems of over-population,
            planned parenthood and contraception. Its reports seem to be toned
            down to keep from offending delegates from countries dominated by
            “Mother” Church. Yet how can the dangers to world peace that always
            threaten to explode in over-populated areas be averted without
            bringing the frank and open discussion of Planned Parenthood to the
            council table?</p>
        <p>We hear much discussion of aid to “backward” and underdeveloped
            areas. But we fail to see that these under-developed areas are
            always <emph rend="underline">over-populated</emph> zones. How long
            can the American people be expected to pay confiscatory taxes to
            support these over-populated lands forever and ever? Yet we read in
            the well-informed <title>Wall Street Journal</title> that foreign
            aid to the extent of <del>the</del> more than eighteen billion
            dollars is to be sent to <place>Asia</place> during the next eight
            years--eighteen billion to be buried in the ever-shifting quicksands
            of a rootless over-populated area-–a territory and a society, in the
            words of the <title>Wall Street Journal</title>, possessing neither
            the economic nor the political sagacity to handle any such sum
            sensibly. Here is another instance of seeking a solution, not by
            radical diagnosis, but by treating <emph rend="underline"
                >effects</emph>. As well might we try to sweep back a tidal wave
            with a whisk-broom!</p>
        <p>We are also reminded by another observer of the Asiatic scene that
            countries suffering from excessive over-population do not value
            human life very highly.</p>
        <p>Before World War I <place>Japan</place> was the classic example of
            over-population, which problem the Empire met by expansion into
            adjacent territories.</p>
        <p>I dwell on these instances to illustrate how intricately and
            integrally bound up with international affairs is the problem of
            over-population in every country. Must the <emph rend="underline"
                >haves</emph> be called upon to support the <emph
                rend="underline">not-haves</emph> indefinitely? Rather, must we
            not insist upon consideration of the world population problem from
            the point of view of the new, as yet untried civilization, seeking
            to enlighten the political leaders and the scientists to the close
            inter-relations and co-relations between inner procreative energies,
            too often uncontrolled and purely instinctual, and the outer
            objective confusion and social chaos which are their
            consequences.</p>
        <p>If we define civilization as increased and increasing responsibility
            based upon vision and foresight, it becomes evident (painfully so)
            that parenthood as practiced today by a large percentage of our
            human race is in no sense civilized. In almost all countries today
            there is one class, which is generally known as “upper class”. Women
            of this class have the most up-to-date maternal care, modern science
            and modern nursing. The maternal and infant death rate is lowest in
            this class. It is from the class that women are able to space the
            births of children in consideration of their health, the fathers
            earning capacity, and the standards of living to be maintained. Here
            we have mothers who, being free from the constant burden of
            pregnancy, can and often do enlist their training and educated
            abilities to increase the family income. These are the mothers who
            enlarge the cultural and religious, political and civic
            organizations in the community. Were they without knowledge of
            planned parenthood, they one and all would fall under the German
            ideal--kitchen, church and cradle from puberty to the menopause.
            This is the fate of millions of women in every country on earth.</p>
        <p>Biological slavery to unwanted pregnancies, and to unwanted babies.
            As we look back over the histories of various civilizations we find
            in nearly every one there were always ways and means of trying to
            control population. Babies of Roman and Grecian countries were left
            to the elements for the first 24 hours of their birth. If the
            youngster survived without food or protection, it was considered
            worth the cost and burden of its upkeep. In <place>Germany</place>,
                <place>Austria</place>, and many other European and Asiatic
            countries, there was the crime of smothering, drowning, abandoning
            and selling infants. In spite of laws, to deliberately kill infants,
            this slaughter was carried on through the Middle Ages until the art
            of abortion became a practice. Mothers were beaten, imprisoned,
            drowned as punishment, threatened with hellfire, but the crimes
            continued as unwanted babies came into existence. The “survival of
            the fit” was perhaps the basic principle which brought our present
            civilization to flower. It may have seemed to be a cruel and
            relentless policy, but the changes from the eugenic laws to feudal
            system had certain values in balancing the birth and death rates.
            Family responsibilities gave dignity and security within the design
            of individual clans.</p>
        <p>Then came the area of philanthropy and charity, where these
            individuals whom nations would have discarded as unfit to survive,
            were taken into palatial buildings, fed and clothed at the expense
            of the fit. They toiled not, neither did they spin, but were free to
            breed, to increase, to multiply recklessly, not only progeny, but
            their idiocy, mental and physical transmittable diseases. Thus the
            old civilization defying nature’s balancing has created an
            overpopulated world, with “cold wars” threatening peaceful
            existence, for the fit and intelligent adults of our present
            civilization.</p>
        <p>In the program of the <org
                reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned
                Parenthood Federation</org> there are helpful clinics and
            physicians to advise parents in spacing th arrival of infants. There
            are also departments to assist and encourage parents who may desire
            additional children. But so far as I am informed, there is no sound
            eugenic clinic to warn men and women against becoming parents.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons to avoid parenthood:</p>
        <p>1. Sometimes for a temporary period only, such as the case where the
            woman may be affected with tuberculosis, heart or kidney disease,
            and other minor ailments when pregnancy is known to slow up the cure
            of these diseases.</p>
        <p>2. Definitely there should be no progeny when either husband or wife
            is affected with a transmissible disease. Sterilization of the one
            so afflicted should be advised.</p>
        <p>3. When parents give birth to children mentally handicapped or
            physical infirmities such as cleft palate, hair lip, blindness, all
            inherited, sterilization should be recommended.</p>
        <p>These are several essential conditions to be considered before
            parenthood is advised.</p>
        <p>Space and limitation have prevented me from taking up the problem of
            the unwanted child. American cities are being forced to consider the
            psychology of the unwanted child, as they discover its relations to
            the ever-growing prison population and mental disturbance. On this
            subject we must agree with <person reg="Price, Marie Perry">Marie
                Perry Price</person>, who in a recent letter to the <title>New
                York Times</title> declared:</p>
        <p>“<q who="PRIMA">A child has a right not to be conceived and born into
                a home, a family or a community that does not want him and makes
                so little provision for his care.</q>”</p>
        <p>If would-be parents were to apply as a test to their fitness for
            parenthood to any adoption agency and reply to the questions that
            are asked by that agency to safeguard the child’s life and to insure
            its health, happiness and development, I believe that more than 50%
            of would-be parents today would be unacceptable by the adoption
            agency to care for children. As along as any civilization encourages
            unrestrained fertility, always there is furnished the most fertile
            breeding class for mental defectives, morons and imbeciles. We
            protect the weak and feeble-minded up to the period of reproduction
            and then set them free to reproduce and increase their kind. The
            prisons and institutions are on the increase with long waiting lists
            of children, as well as adults to be admitted. Here is where the
            healthy and fit must limit the increase of the own progeny in order
            to support the increase of the diseased unfit. To continue this
            process at the insistence of the old civilization is to dramatically
            submerge and eventually wipe out the talented geniuses of this
            generation and give over the inmates of the institutions the
            creation of a future civilization.</p>
        <p>Despite all the changes, the achievements and the disasters of the
            last four decades, I still have renewed hope for an enlightened
            civilization, especially as it is embodied in the program for
            planned parenthood. I can still agree with the <person
                reg="H&ouml;lderlin, Friedrich">young poet</person> who write in
            the midst of the French Revolution, nearly two centuries ago:</p>
        <p>“<q who="HOLFR">....I love the generations of the centuries to come.
                For this is my most blessed hope, the faith which keeps me
                strong and active, that our grandchildren will be better than
                we. These seeds of enlightenment...for the improvement of the
                human race will spread and grow strong and bear glorious
                fruit.</q>”</p>
