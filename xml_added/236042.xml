        <head rend="underline">CIVILIZING POWER OF<title/> PLANNED PARENTHOOD</head>
        <byline><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p>Many years ago I wrote and published a book entitled “<title type="book">The Pivot of
                Civilization</title>.” The point of this book was that the future of civilization
            is, in all its phases, dependent upon Planned Parenthood––or Birth Control, as we
            expressed the idea of contraception in those pioneering days. I was brought to a new
            realization of how swiftly we have moved in these past thirty years. Our civilization
            has wrought miracles on one level, and plunged humanity into disaster and chaos on
            another. Our civilization gives evidence of an <emph rend="underline">inner</emph>
            conflict. It suffers from a “split personality”.</p>
        <p>First let us look at the miracles it has wrought. Its scientists and engineers have
            harnessed and controlled the vast forces of external nature. Just glance at the vast
            hydro-electric projects, furnishing millions upon millions of horsepower, by converting
            wild water resources into electric power. Think of man’s conquest of the implacable law
            of gravitation, which produced the miracle of aviation, by which we all profit. Consider
            man’s achievement in electronics, and the miracles of television and radio
            communications. And finally, the scientists who have explored the atom have released
            upon our world the mysterious resources of atomic energy–-with its cast potentials for
            good–-and for evil!</p>
        <p>But while Mankind--and in the last few decades, mind you--has conquered and controlled
            and tamed the vast heretofore forces of the outer universe, we can find only slight
            success in the control and conquest of the inner, subjective drives and passions within
            human nature itself. Blind energies riot uncontrolled through the vast human species,
            populating this little globe! We find ourselves confronted not only by WAR--hot and
            cold!–-but all the other appalling consequences of uncontrolled population increase:
            Whole communities of thousands and of millions are uprooted from their homes, driven
            into exile, victims of mass extermination, of epidemics, of famine, starvation, despised
            and rejected; slave labor camps replacing the concentration camps; or millions sent to
            the steppes of <place reg="Siberia, Soviet Union">eastern Siberia</place> with the
            command of the Soviet despots to populate those barren areas!</p>
        <p>Confronted by these mass tragedies, with their chaos and confusion it would be
            hypocritical to speak of <add>a</add> Civilization in this age. But I could not help
            thinking how much more humane it might be if our great scientists had turned away from
            the invention of A-bombs and H-bombs, with their atrocious power of destruction, to the
            more necessary and benign task of producing a reliable, efficient, cheaply produced and
            easily distributed contraceptive. The victimized mothers of the world would with one
            great voice thank them as the benefactors of humanity today and all the future. How much
            greater would be this service to Civilization, instead of the present unholy alliance
            between Science and the powers of destruction!</p>
        <p>I believe that all of you who have studied the new statistics of comparative demography,
            the discoveries of the new social anthropology, the findings of the impartial
            geneticists, the experts in population and over-population, must agree with me that our
            civilization, however great its outer achievements, has failed to probe to the root
            causes of human miseries. Too often it has expended its energies in seeking to bridge
            order out of chaos, instead of, with farseeing vision preventing the great human
            catastrophies.</p>
        <p>To my book <title type="book">“The Pivot of Civilization”</title>, my good friend, the late <person
                reg="Wells, H. G.">H. G. Wells</person> contributed an introduction in which he
            contrasted the new progressive, experimental ideal of civilization with that of the old
            static, traditional way of life dominated by Mother Church and Father State. Mr. Wells
            surveyed, as a historian, several civilizations of the past and present. Today we are
            living, he believed, not in a simple or complete civilization, but in a conflict of at
            least two civilizations. One of these he called the Traditional or Authoritative
            civilization which rests blindly upon the customs of past generations. It insists upon
            respect and obedience to the powers that be. It discourages criticism and inquiry. It is
            not only ancient, but conservative and reactionary.</p>
        <p>Contrasted with the older civilization we find that Mr. Wells calls the <add>new</add>
            civilization <add>one</add> of inquiry, of experiment, knowledge and science. Creative
            and progressive civilization says “<q who="TENAL">Let knowledge grow from more to more
                and more of reverence in us dwell.</q>” “<q who="WELHG">Let man know and trust
                him.</q>” These two forces today are at war upon a thousand issues. Ancient
            civilizations all encouraged unrestricted breeding to meet the catastrophic waste of
            life through wars, pestilence, floods and periodic epidemics. The new civilization has
            conquered to a large extent the scourges, floods and preventible diseases, but confronts
            us with the explosive dangers of an overpopulated world. We find the old civilization
            clamoring for more and more babies-–the cry “Our babies are dying,give us more babies.”
            They will eventually become consumers say the Communists. They put all the answers to
            over-populated areas--“Let them emigrate. Let them expand their industry!” Under our
            very eyes, as reported in the newspapers, we can watch the Soviets sending to the
            steppes of Siberia thousands upon thousands of young men and women to breed and populate
            a now barren territory. According to a special dispatch to the <title>New York
                Times</title> for <place reg="Moscow, Soviet Union">Moscow</place>:</p>
        <p>“<q who="DANCL">Last year 150,000 young men and women were sent out as pioneers to the
                new lands. This year, according to the <org>Komsomol</org>, Communist youth
                organization, 620,000 others volunteered to join the first settlers. The Komsomol
                has chosen 165,000 of whom 55,000 have already gone east. Every few days several
                carloads of migrants leave from the big city stations.</q>”</p>
        <p>This example illustrates the authoritarian despotism of the so-called Soviet civilization
            (however much the Soviets may boast of their progressiveness). Population policies are
            decided by Father State, or in <person reg="Orwell, George">Orwell</person>’s
                satire-–“<q who="ORWGE">Big Brother knows best!</q>”</p>
        <p>The new civilizing power of Planned Parenthood, in contrast, liberates the potential
            mother and wife from the despotic decrees of Father State–-or Mother Church. It restores
            self-direction, self-decision, self-determination of the parents to advance the family.
            Planned Parenthood recognizes the desire on the part of husband and wife to build up a
            healthy, happy family; to recognize and accept responsibility of the number of children
            in the family. It envisages education for parenthood before arrival of offspring, the
            spacing of births in consideration of the mother’s health, the father’s earning capacity
            and the standards of living and culture to be maintained.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the older, vanishing civilization, which was limited and nationalistic in
            scope, the new civilization assumes world-wide responsibilities. This new
            internationalism is embodied in the ideals of the <org>United Nations</org>
            organization. But as far as I have been able to discover, the United Nations and its
            subsidiary bodies have shied away from the basic problems of over-population, planned
            parenthood and contraception. Its reports seem to be toned down to keep from offending
            delegates from countries dominated by “Mother” Church. Yet how can the dangers to world
            peace that always threaten to explode in over-populated areas be averted without
            bringing the frank and open discussion of Planned Parenthood to the council table?</p>
        <p>We hear much discussion of aid to “backward” and underdeveloped areas. But we fail to see
            that these under-developed areas are always <emph rend="underline">over-populated</emph>
            zones. How long can the American people be expected to pay confiscatory taxes to support
            these over-populated lands forever and ever? Yet we read in the well-informed
                <title type="journal">Wall Street Journal</title> that foreign aid to the extent of <del>the</del>
            more than eighteen billion dollars is to be sent to <place>Asia</place> during the next
            eight years--eighteen billion to be buried in the ever-shifting quicksands of a rootless
            over-populated area-–a territory and a society, in the words of the <title type="journal">Wall Street
                Journal</title>, possessing neither the economic nor the political sagacity to
            handle any such sum sensibly. Here is another instance of seeking a solution, not by
            radical diagnosis, but by treating <emph rend="underline">effects</emph>. As well might
            we try to sweep back a tidal wave with a whisk-broom!</p>
        <p>We are also reminded by another observer of the Asiatic scene that countries suffering
            from excessive over-population do not value human life very highly.</p>
        <p>Before World War I <place>Japan</place> was the classic example of over-population, which
            problem the Empire met by expansion into adjacent territories.</p>
        <p>I dwell on these instances to illustrate how intricately and integrally bound up with
            international affairs is the problem of over-population in every country. Must the <emph
                rend="underline">haves</emph> be called upon to support the <emph rend="underline"
                >not-haves</emph> indefinitely? Rather, must we not insist upon consideration of the
            world population problem from the point of view of the new, as yet untried civilization,
            seeking to enlighten the political leaders and the scientists to the close
            inter-relations and co-relations between inner procreative energies, too often
            uncontrolled and purely instinctual, and the outer objective confusion and social chaos
            which are their consequences.</p>
        <p>If we define civilization as increased and increasing responsibility based upon vision
            and foresight, it becomes evident (painfully so) that parenthood as practiced today by a
            large percentage of our human race is in no sense civilized. In almost all countries
            today there is one class, which is generally known as “upper class”. Women of this class
            have the most up-to-date maternal care, modern science and modern nursing. The maternal
            and infant death rate is lowest in this class. It is from the class that women are able
            to space the births of children in consideration of their health, the fathers earning
            capacity, and the standards of living to be maintained. Here we have mothers who, being
            free from the constant burden of pregnancy, can and often do enlist their training and
            educated abilities to increase the family income. These are the mothers who enlarge the
            cultural and religious, political and civic organizations in the community. Were they
            without knowledge of planned parenthood, they one and all would fall under the German
            ideal--kitchen, church and cradle from puberty to the menopause. This is the fate of
            millions of women in every country on earth.</p>
        <p>Biological slavery to unwanted pregnancies, and to unwanted babies. As we look back over
            the histories of various civilizations we find in nearly every one there were always
            ways and means of trying to control population. Babies of Roman and Grecian countries
            were left to the elements for the first 24 hours of their birth. If the youngster
            survived without food or protection, it was considered worth the cost and burden of its
            upkeep. In <place>Germany</place>, <place>Austria</place>, and many other European and
            Asiatic countries, there was the crime of smothering, drowning, abandoning and selling
            infants. In spite of laws, to deliberately kill infants, this slaughter was carried on
            through the Middle Ages until the art of abortion became a practice. Mothers were
            beaten, imprisoned, drowned as punishment, threatened with hellfire, but the crimes
            continued as unwanted babies came into existence. The “survival of the fit” was perhaps
            the basic principle which brought our present civilization to flower. It may have seemed
            to be a cruel and relentless policy, but the changes from the eugenic laws to feudal
            system had certain values in balancing the birth and death rates. Family
            responsibilities gave dignity and security within the design of individual clans.</p>
        <p>Then came the area of philanthropy and charity, where these individuals whom nations
            would have discarded as unfit to survive, were taken into palatial buildings, fed and
            clothed at the expense of the fit. They toiled not, neither did they spin, but were free
            to breed, to increase, to multiply recklessly, not only progeny, but their idiocy,
            mental and physical transmittable diseases. Thus the old civilization defying nature’s
            balancing has created an overpopulated world, with “cold wars” threatening peaceful
            existence, for the fit and intelligent adults of our present civilization.</p>
        <p>In the program of the <org reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned
                Parenthood Federation</org> there are helpful clinics and physicians to advise
            parents in spacing th arrival of infants. There are also departments to assist and
            encourage parents who may desire additional children. But so far as I am informed, there
            is no sound eugenic clinic to warn men and women against becoming parents.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons to avoid parenthood:</p>
        <p>1. Sometimes for a temporary period only, such as the case where the woman may be
            affected with tuberculosis, heart or kidney disease, and other minor ailments when
            pregnancy is known to slow up the cure of these diseases.</p>
        <p>2. Definitely there should be no progeny when either husband or wife is affected with a
            transmissible disease. Sterilization of the one so afflicted should be advised.</p>
        <p>3. When parents give birth to children mentally handicapped or physical infirmities such
            as cleft palate, hair lip, blindness, all inherited, sterilization should be
            recommended.</p>
        <p>These are several essential conditions to be considered before parenthood is advised.</p>
        <p>Space and limitation have prevented me from taking up the problem of the unwanted child.
            American cities are being forced to consider the psychology of the unwanted child, as
            they discover its relations to the ever-growing prison population and mental
            disturbance. On this subject we must agree with <person reg="Price, Marie Perry">Marie
                Perry Price</person>, who in a recent letter to the <title type="journal">New York Times</title>
            declared:</p>
        <p>“<q who="PRIMA">A child has a right not to be conceived and born into a home, a family or
                a community that does not want him and makes so little provision for his
            care.</q>”</p>
        <p>If would-be parents were to apply as a test to their fitness for parenthood to any
            adoption agency and reply to the questions that are asked by that agency to safeguard
            the child’s life and to insure its health, happiness and development, I believe that
            more than 50% of would-be parents today would be unacceptable by the adoption agency to
            care for children. As along as any civilization encourages unrestrained fertility,
            always there is furnished the most fertile breeding class for mental defectives, morons
            and imbeciles. We protect the weak and feeble-minded up to the period of reproduction
            and then set them free to reproduce and increase their kind. The prisons and
            institutions are on the increase with long waiting lists of children, as well as adults
            to be admitted. Here is where the healthy and fit must limit the increase of the own
            progeny in order to support the increase of the diseased unfit. To continue this process
            at the insistence of the old civilization is to dramatically submerge and eventually
            wipe out the talented geniuses of this generation and give over the inmates of the
            institutions the creation of a future civilization.</p>
        <p>Despite all the changes, the achievements and the disasters of the last four decades, I
            still have renewed hope for an enlightened civilization, especially as it is embodied in
            the program for planned parenthood. I can still agree with the <person
                reg="H&ouml;lderlin, Friedrich">young poet</person> who write in the midst of the
            French Revolution, nearly two centuries ago:</p>
        <p>“<q who="HOLFR">....I love the generations of the centuries to come. For this is my most
                blessed hope, the faith which keeps me strong and active, that our grandchildren
                will be better than we. These seeds of enlightenment...for the improvement of the
                human race will spread and grow strong and bear glorious fruit.</q>”</p>
