            America and abroad, will speak today on “The Real Meaning of Birth
            control.” It is fitting that her address should be part of the
            regular Woman's Club program since women are so deeply concerned
            with the cause she advocates, and as individuals and organized
            groups have given her such effective support. Mrs. Margaret Sanger

        <p>Birth control means happier, more stable homes. It means better
            babies and healthier, happier mothers. No one can object to these
            aims, for it is by our common love for children and home that we
                <add>women</add> are all knit together. Birth control means no
            more -- and no less -- than the application of science and reason to
            the most important of all human undertakings -- the <add>bearing
                &amp;</add> rearing of the next generation.</p>
        <p>It seems to me that if people would keep in mind this simple idea,
            there would not and could not be any opposition to birth control.
            Medical science has taken this matter out of the realm of blind
            chance. We can assist nature, and control births as we control other
            great forces in life. The sum total of all control over the blind
            forces of nature is what we call civilization.</p>
        <p>Birth control means giving mothers a chance to plan their families
            and space their children. It means giving them knowledge with which
            to make a success of the greatest career a woman can
            have...motherhood.</p>
        <p>Mother love, in the very best sense of the word, is what prompts
            women <add>the world over</add> to plead for birth control
            information. During the <add>20</add> years of my activity in the
            birth control cause I have received <del>thousands upon thousands
                of</del><add>over a million personal</add> letters from mothers.
            They ask for information for a wide variety of reasons...but the one
            common reason, that run like a golden thread through all the
            letters, is mother love!</p>
        <p><del>This</del>Here is a letter from a young wife who is
                looking<del>towards <gap extent="two words" reason="illegible"
                /></del>
            <add>forward to being a mother</add>: “<q who="UNK">I was married
                when I was eighteen</q>,” She writes. <q who="UNK">I am not yet
                twenty and my husband doesn't feel that we are financially able
                to care for a child properly yet. I am sure that <del><gap
                        extent="one word" reason="illegible"/></del>my children
                    <add>when I have them</add> and I will be the better for it,
                if I can wait until I am twenty, at least, before I have a baby.
                But meantime what shall I do?</q></p>
        <p>“<q who="UNK">I want the truth. I want to find out from someone who
                knows. I am so afraid, I might spoil my chances for motherhood
                later and I want children. Please help <add>me</add></q>.</p>
        <p><del>Is </del><add>Do you think</add> this young wife entitled to the
            very best information that medical science can give her? I think you
            will feel with me that she is.</p>
        <p>Here is a letter from a child wife who wants to give her
                <add>living</add> children a chance. Mother love impells her to
            write. As I read her letter <add>to you</add> bear in mind that this
            is an American woman who pleads <add>to me</add> for help, not a
            mother in some far distant land. \“<q who="UNK">I married at
            15</q>,” she writes, “<q who="UNK">and my first baby came before I
                was 17! Now at 25 I have seven children. We are poor and aren't
                able to buy clothes or even food at times. We started farming
                for ourselves last year, and I feel that if I could only keep
                from having any more babies, we could in a few years, give
                    <del>the </del><add>these dear</add> children a decent
                break.</q>”</p>
        <p>Should this young mother have a chance (to help herself) or should
            she be left in ignorance?</p>
        <p>And one last letter which I am going to read tells a story that is
            all too typical. “<q who="UNK">My husband works on the <org
                    reg="Works Progress Administration">WPA</org>,</q>” writes a
            mother 27 <add>years old.</add> “<q who="UNK">I have five children,
                the oldest is seven. I would surely be glad if you could help
                me.</q>”<add>27 years 20 years more of child bearing</add></p>
        <p><add>This</add> family on relief, five children and a mother and
            father dependent on the government for their subsistence. Shall we
            withold from them knowledge which is needed if they are ever to
            regain a foot hold in life? <add>Is it fair? I think you will agree
                with me that it is not.</add></p>
        <p><person reg="Roosevelt, Franklin Delano">President Roosevelt</person>
            in one of his recent fireside talks said that one-third of the
            people of America are ill housed, ill clothed and ill nourished. I
            venture to state that <del>one</del><add>two</add> thirds of
            America's mothers are living in fear and darkness, that their love
            for their children born and unborn urges them constantly to
                <add>worry &amp; to</add> seek, <del>to learn how to plan their
                families </del><add>for knowledge to control the size of the
                family</add>.</p>
        <p>Our national <org reg="United States Children's Bureau">Children's
                Bureau</org> has studied maternal and infant mortality and has
            tried to discover how to reduce these tragic deaths. It has found
            out that children should not be born too close together, if they are
            to survive; that mothers should not be too old or too young; that
            there is a direct relation between adequate funds, <add>father's
                wages,</add> economic security, and the chances of survival for
            mothers and infants.</p>
        <p>If we are to take advantage of these findings, that is, if we are to
            allow mothers to see <add>to it</add> that their children do not
            come too close, we must give them information as to how to plan
            their pregnancies.. in other words, we must give them birth control
            information. Birth control for child spacing, birth control when the
            mother is too young, (or too old), birth control when <del>no one
                </del><add>the father's wages</add> will not provide proper care
                <add>for the children.</add> This seems to me to admit of no
            argument <add>in a country that calls itself
                    <unclear>civilized</unclear>.</add></p>
        <p>I am sure that as I read the letters from mothers, each of you said:
            “Why, of course, SHE ought to be told what to do.” Multiply these
            letters by thousands and millions and you will get some picture of
            the women who should have birth control instruction <add>in this
                country of ours.</add></p>
        <p>I hasten to add the phrase.. If they want it! Fort this information
            is not being forced upon anyone. It is only for those <add>mothers
                and fathers</add> who want it and need it.</p>
        <p>I am happy to learn that here in <place reg="Berks County, PA">Berks
                County</place> you have a wide spread organization for giving
            birth control instruction to mothers. I am told that there are
            eleven centers in the county, all connected with the central office
            here in Reading. In all these centers doctors are able and willing
            to give mothers advice. Nurses and supplies are furnished by the
            central office at 408 Franklin Street, Reading. Social and Welfare
            agencies, ministers, and all who are in touch with mothers who need
            this advice are urged to find out about birth control service near
            their homes from the Berks County Office in Reading <add>Newer
                methods, safer, more reliable than “over the counter” methods
                are now employed. Your physician can give.</add></p>
        <p>This is a fine set up and I am proud to be speaking in a community
            and a county which has so clearly seen the need for this service. I
            look forward to the time when every county in the entire United
            States will have such service.</p>
        <p>Up to the present time we were working against terrible odds. The
            so-called Comstock law, passed by <org reg="United States Congress"
                >Congress</org> at the behest of <person reg="Comstock, Anthony"
                >Anthony Comstock</person> more than sixty years ago stood inthe
            way. This law classed the prevention of conception with obscenity,
            and made it a crime to send birth control information or supplied
            through the mail or by express. It also forbid the importation of
            such material and information. This law was a tragic stumbling
            block. It hindered physicians, it retarded research and scientific
            study, it confused and besmearched and tangled a matter which should
            rightfully <del>have been </del><add>be</add> a part of medical
            practice.</p>
        <p>Early in my fight to make birth control accessible to all mothers who
            need it, I saw that for real progress this law must be changed. With
            this in mind, I organized the <org>National Committee on Federal
                Legislation for Birth Control</org> and enlisted the aid of
            individuals and groups. We sought an amendment to the Comstock law,
            which would exempt physicians from its restrictions. Bills were
            introduced, hearings were held, the press gave its support.
            Organized women's clubs were among our staunch supporters. Public
            opinion was aroused and made itself felt. <add>Organizations
                totaling over 22 million members endorsed our efforts to get the
                laws changed.</add></p>
        <p>We fought a test case on the importation of birth control materials
            sent to a physician for research purposes. A wise and courageous
            court decision has brought this legal struggle to a victorious
            close. The <org>United States Circuit Court of Appeals</org>, for
            the second circuit <add>on Nov. 30, 1936</add> handed down a
            decision which is a Bill of Rights for the medical profession in the
            field of birth control <del>on November 30th, 1936</del>. This will
            be hailed as a red letter day when the final history of our movement
            is written. The judges interpreted the Comstock law in the light of
            modern science and modern thought, and said:</p>
        <p>“<q who="USCCA">We are satisfied that its design was not to prevent
                the importation, sale or carriage by mail of things which might
                intelligently be employed by conscientious and competent
                physicians for the purpose of saving life or promoting the well
                being of their patients.</q>”</p>
        <p>Birth control is now legal. The <org>United States government</org>
            decided not to carry the case to the <org
                reg="United States Supreme Court">Supreme Court</org>, and thus,
            the decision I have just read in part, becomes, in effect, the law
            of the land. I urge you who are listening to me to read about this
            case and to get the full meaning of the judges decision.</p>
        <p>It opens the way to a new and wider program for birth control. It
            means that mothers such as those who wrote to me pleading for help
            can <add>now</add> get it as their right and their due.</p>
        <p>For birth control is a part of public health work and should be
            included in public health programs. It is a necessary part of all
            work with mothers and infants and children, and all agencies which
            deal with these problems should and soon will, I prophecy, include
            it as a regular part of their work. <add>Two ways you can help send
                mothers to the center for this help, and you can furnish the
                cost which these poor mothers cannot pay.</add></p>
        <p>I am happy to be in <place>Pennsylvania</place> where so fine a start
            has been made, and I look to this state, and this county to point
            the way toward the larger fields into which we can now enter.</p>
