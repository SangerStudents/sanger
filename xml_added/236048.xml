        <p>Friends of P.P.</p>
        <p>In spirit I welcome you all here today-- Regret exceedingly that I have been detained in
            LA.</p>
        <p>The International situation in relation to Birth Control &amp; Population has grown to
            such an extent that much help must be given in advice, lectures, articles &amp;
            organizations.</p>
        <p><place>India</place> especially &amp; <place>Japan</place> as well are buzzing with
            interest.</p>
        <p><person reg="Stone, Abraham">Dr Stone</person> the medical Director of our <org
                reg="Margaret Sanger Research Bureau">Bureau</org> in <place reg="New York, NY">N.
                Y.</place> was invited by the <org reg="World Health Organization">W.H.O.</org> in
                <place reg="Genva, Switzerland">Geneva</place> to go to India to set up Pilot
            clinics under the guidance of the <person reg="Unknown">Director of Public
                Health</person> in India.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister <person reg="Nehru, Jawaharlal">Nehru</person> came out in the open in his
            address on Public Welfare to advise Birth Control centers through out India.</p>
        <p>This is a great Victory for the International movement that others with less courage
            previously now dare to endorse the work--</p>
        <p>The <org reg="International Committee on Planned Parenthood">International
                Committee</org> in <place reg="London, England">London</place> of which I am an
            American representative has been invited to hold the next BC Conference in India in
            1952.</p>
        <p>Plans are proceeding toward this event-- The date as to month &amp; day has yet to be
            decided but we may say November--in <place reg="Bombay, India">Bombay</place> or <place
                reg="New Delhi, India">New Dehli</place>-- Other <org
                reg="First International Study Conference on Child Welfare">Int Conferences on Child
                Welfare</org> &amp; <org
                reg=" First International Study Conference on Child Welfare">Social Work</org> are
            being held in Dec at <place reg="Madras, India">Madras</place>-- We are asked to
            cooperate with these agencies &amp; are of course happy to do so. <place>Japan</place>
            is another interesting country-- The Japanese people are awake to the problem of over
            population.</p>
        <p>I am invited again to go to Japan--a meeting of 3000 men &amp; women on Dec 6--issued an
            invitation to me to come to Japan in the Spring of 52. But as we who are going to India
            will pass through Japan--we are asking to be allow us to stop at that time instead of
            making a trip to Japan in the Spring--</p>
        <p><place>Singapore</place> has several BC Clinics, the government has given $5000.00 for
            supplies to the 7 clinics in that locality. All over the world the idea is
            spreading--and now you will soon receive a <rs
                reg="Around the World News of Population and Birth Control"><title type="journal"
                    >news Bulletin</title></rs>--with International News. Edited by my friend
                <person reg="Brush, Dorothy Hamilton">Mrs Charles F Brush</person> in New York. This
            is only a four sheet News Bulletin, we hope to have money enough within a year to make
            it a real magazine-- It's bubbling with news &amp; most encouraging to us all.</p>
        <p>I am to be on T.V. in <place reg="Hollywood, California">Hollywood</place> to debate the
            question of BC &amp; its importance to Civilization. The opponent is a <person
                reg="Spurck, Estelle H.">R. Catholic mother of nine children</person>. There is the
            possibility of my returning on time for this meeting but here are a few of the
            Highlights in case I am delayed.</p>
        <p><del>You are so welcome to be in my home-- The Tucson Group will continue to do the
                splendid work begun several years ago--</del></p>
