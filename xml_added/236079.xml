        <p>In the hands of the most enlightened, both science and poetry are
            invaluable tools in freeing humanity from bondage. It is to the
            scientists that we are indebted for the new realization of the
            sexual impulse as the basis of altruism, the realization of the
            physiological and psychic value of its joyful fulfillment, and the
            appreciation of the social responsibility which accompanies this
            fulfillment. But to make this knowledge operative by bringing it
            home to the heart as well as mind is particularly a poet’s
            opportunity for service--an opportunity brilliantly followed by
            Ralph Cheyney.</p>
        <p>One of the first masculine poets to write on the feminine side, Ralph
            Cheyney presents no worship of sex per se but a reverent attitude
            toward sex as an experience valuable in itself and of vastly more
            vital significance in its consequences. Throughout <title>
                <emph rend="Italics">Pregnant Woman in a Lean Age</emph>
            </title>, he expresses such realizations as that of <person
                reg="Ellis, Havelock">Havelock Ellis</person> when he wrote of
                “<q who="ELLHA">the sacrament of sex</q>.” In so doing, Ralph
            Cheyney performs a vital service.</p>
