        <p><title type="book">PREGNANT WOMAN IN A LEAN AGE</title> by <person reg="Cheyney, Ralph"

        <p>In the hands of the most enlightened, both science and poetry are invaluable tools in
            freeing humanity from bondage. It is to the scientists that we are indebted for the new
            realization of the sexual impulse as the basis of altruism, the realization of the
            physiological and psychic value of its joyful fulfillment, and the appreciation of the
            social responsibility which accompanies this fulfillment. But to make this knowledge
            operative by bringing it home to the heart as well as mind is particularly a poet’s
            opportunity for service--an opportunity brilliantly followed by Ralph Cheyney.</p>
        <p>One of the first masculine poets to write on the feminine side, Ralph Cheyney presents no
            worship of sex per se but a reverent attitude toward sex as an experience valuable in
            itself and of vastly more vital significance in its consequences. Throughout <title>
                <title type="book" rend="Italics">Pregnant Woman in a Lean Age</title>
            </title>, he expresses such realizations as that of <person reg="Ellis, Havelock"
                >Havelock Ellis</person> when he wrote of “<q who="ELLHA">the sacrament of sex</q>.”
            In so doing, Ralph Cheyney performs a vital service.</p>
