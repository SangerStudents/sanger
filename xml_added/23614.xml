        <p>Bc has become the keynote of a New Social + racial responsibility. It is the
            consciousness of a New Individual responsibility not only for the Children already born
            but for the welfare of children not yet conceived.</p>
        <p>This attitude marks a new + superior sense in the history of mankind. It marks a New
            Social Era as being not only a health expedient but a Social principle which is
            intermingled + tied to the spiritual progress + advancement of the race + its
            future.</p>
        <p>Its practice makes for a resistant race,maintains initiatives + responsiblity. Today 1/3
            of the population are creating conditions for dependency killing initiatives +
            responsibility.</p>
        <p>The only people who can afford larger families are those who can’t support them.</p>
        <p>Many good people are fearful of Communism + would depart from our shores all these with
            such political + social ideas but I say that the most revolutionary Communist is not as
            great an <del>danger</del>
            <add>enemy</add> to our nation as the fanatic who oppress all efforts to decrease the
            multiplication of the defectives criminal + unfit populations of this country.</p>
        <p>Here is the real Enemy. insidious + <del>purposeful</del>
            <emph rend="underline">+ dangerous</emph> of Foreign <emph rend="underline"
                >Extinction</emph>.</p>
        <p>I wish they would take men + pay the cost of their <add>own</add> increasing hordes +
            Maintain this large unfit population thus relieving the tax payers of increasingly heavy
            burdens.</p>
        <p>Our politicians attack the <org>Communists</org> + urge their deportation because they
            fear their ideas will destroy our form or system of <org reg="US government"
                >government</org>. But our system of gov’t can be maintained, changed, defended if
            we have a population of men + women <del>able to</del> with <del>the</del> intelligence
            to deal with it.</p>
        <p>But with 85% of our population mentally under the age of a juvenile 14 years
                <del>old</del>, we can expect all the problems which <del>family expect</del>
            parents face with their own adolescents. </p>
        <p> But the real criminal to be feared is not the Communist or facist or any other growth to
            interfere or change our cities or external life. It is the man or woman or group who
            encourage the increase of defectives + criminal breeding + prevents others from doing
            their civic duty to the state in attempting to curtail their increase. Opponents of Bc
            are responsible for their dysgenic birth rate. 80% mental equipment of 14 year old
            juveniles. <person>David Starr Jordan</person>’s Princeton: 25,000,000 mediocre

            to preserving the health of the nation + future generations.</p>
        <p>The most important task before our health + gov’t officials today is to find effectual
            means of controlling + limiting the propagation of the mentally unfit, including
            feebleminded, psychotic + unstable, mentally retarded individuals.</p>

            beings are on parole while 150,000 patients are admitted or readmitted to these
            institutions every year. 75,000 are in institutes for the feebleminded + epileptic while
            another 900,000 mental defectives are outside institutional care. (Creating problems +
            having babies) $150,000,000 of public funds over 1⁄4 of all health + medical services by
