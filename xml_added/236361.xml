        <p><place>India</place>s Civilization old--</p>
        <p> One of the factors which has definitely influenced a “speeding up” of civilization has
            been the <del>replacement</del>
            <add>application</add> of knowledge &amp; Science to control <del>over</del> Nature.</p>
        <p> Today in all civilized countries to a certain degree this <add>control</add> is applied
            to our environment our health, our food, &amp; apparently the more <add>widely</add> it
            is applied the faster civilization advances.</p>
        <p> In the past civilizations were confronted with one last problem-- The pressure of
            population upon the food supply:</p>
        <p> Nature with all her ruthlessness came <del>as the</del> with disease, pestilence,
            famine, floods &amp; wars &amp; relieved the pressure &amp; settled the population
            problem for a time at least.</p>
        <p> Civilization is gauged by certain factors or conditions which promote enlightenment and
            progress &amp; bring the greatest good to the greatest number.</p>
        <p> One of the recent factors in our civilization has been the control over nature: the
            control over environment &amp; insistently &amp; applying knowledge, intelligence,
            science to our lives instead of blind chance.</p>
        <p> This especially has been applied to the function of procreation or child bearing as
            witnessed or a perusal of the birth &amp; death rates in all western countries will
            demonstrate. </p>
