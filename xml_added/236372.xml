		<p>There are few subjects which have so large a practical significance, and at the same time
			cut so deeply into the foundations of Social Evolution, as Birth Control.</p>
		<p>There have been few other questions of equal importance <emph rend="underline"
				>left</emph> so long in equal obscurity, &amp; none perhaps which can show so
			unequaled a leap in our social vista as birth control has done in so brief a period of
			time.</p>
		<p>What is B. C.?</p>
		<p>Our definition is conscious control of birth rate. Scientific means prevent conception of
			human life.</p>
		<p>Why--you may ask is it necessary to prevent the conception of human life.</p>
		<p>Because civilization is confronted with two serious problems.</p>
		<p>1) That of the pressure of population on the food supply.</p>
		<p>&amp;</p>
		<p>2) That of reconciling humanitarianism with race improvement.</p>
		<p>B. C. is the key to both of these problems.</p>
		<p>History supports the fact that war famines, pestilence have always operated to settle the
			population problem. With the development of humanitarianism natures methods tend to be
			checked. Consequently civilization is menaced by the increasing swarming hordes of
			diseased, feebleminded &amp; unfit.</p>
