        <p>There are few subjects which have so large a practical significance &amp; at the same time
            cut so deeply into the foundation of social evolution as B.C.</p>
        <p>There have been few other questions of Equal importance left so long in equal obscurity,
            &amp; none perhaps which can show so unequaled a leap in our Social vista as B.C. has done
            in so brief a period of time.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago the words were a crime. Today <org reg="Yale University Divinity School">Yale Divinity

        <p>The youth of today will <del>must</del> recover the blunders of prejudice &amp; ignorance &amp; keep us
            to face the facts of life.</p>
        <p>B.C. has become the mark of a superior source of moral responsibility. </p>
        <p>What is B.C.?</p>
        <p>Conscious control of birth rate, measure prevents contraception of human life.</p>
        <p>Why <del>prevent</del>
            <add>control population</add> birth rate. </p>
        <p>Because civilization is confronted with two problems-that of pressure of population on
            food supply, that of reconciling humanitarianism with race improvement.</p>
        <p>The conscious control of the birth rate is the key to both.</p>
        <p>Population can be controlled by increasing death or decreasing birth rate.</p>
        <p>History supports the fact that death rate controlled populations. Values method, disease,
            famine, pestilence then operated to settle the question.</p>
        <p>Barbarianism, savages, Early civilization-infanticide, abandonment, foeticide </p>

        <p><place reg="Central Europe">Middle Western Europe</place> Middle Ages to End of 18th Century infanticide prevalent</p>
        <p>B.C. will wipe out practice of foeticide &amp; infanticide as <unclear/>,infanticide</p>
