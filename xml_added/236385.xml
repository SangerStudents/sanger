            <p><q who="CT">Mrs. Sanger rang the changes on the deplorable conditions brought about
                    by the reproduction of the insane, the feeble-minded, the tubercular, the very
                    poor, and the dependant. She told touching stories of young couples, struggling
                    with adversity and babies during the first years of their married life. She
                    described the hardships of poor mothers with large families. She said that it
                    was cruel to deny the means of preventing conception to a woman, who does not
                    want children; and she stated that abortion is very commonly practiced.</q></p>
            <p><q who="CT">As an alleged panacea for all this and much more, Mrs. Sanger prescribes
                    a system of birth control, which would provide physicians and nurses to intrust
                    females in the ways and means of preventing conception. She claims these as some
                    of the advantages of her system:</q></p>
            <p><q who="CT">Newly-weds could enjoy marital life a year or so without fear of
                    pregnancy. Women, who want children, can have children when they wish; and
                    women, who do not like babies, need not have any. Parents can put more into the
                    raising of a few children; and</q> "we want a race of thoroughbreds."</p>
