        <p>We are soon to witness the opening of the <org>New York World’s Fair</org> and will
            doubtless stand amazed at the progress that Science, Invention and Medicine have made
            during the past century. We shall find eloquent evidence that man has taken remarkable
            steps in the conquest of the external forces of Nature and has harnessed natural
            energies and controlled them for his own use. He has successfully spanned the ocean,
            flung railroads across continents, conquered the air, harnessed the endless torrents of
            water power. Through the lenses of his telescope he has explored distant universes.
            Through the lenses of his microscope he has waged war against germs and microbes. He has
            girded the globe in a fraction of a second with radio broadcasting. Everything has been
            accomplished in a desire to unite peoples and nations--to bring them closer
            together.</p>
        <p>Yet--because he has utterly neglected to control and direct that great creative force
            within human nature itself--the power of his own fertility--and has allowed ceaseless
            hordes of human beings to multiply and increase beyond their capacity to provide for
            themselves, we now find nations and peoples separated by hatred, bitterness and
            jealousies, and mankind goaded on to a frenzy of exploitation, aggression, arrogance and
            war.</p>
        <p>We now witness the conflict of two forces in nature--the slow growth of the mind and the
            high power of human fertility. One is of slow development, the other can multiply itself
            beyond the mind’s capacity to deal with it. It is this uncontrolled force, the results
            of which now screams to us across the world.</p>
        <p>The population of <place>Europe</place> which was 200 million in 1800 rose to 600 million
            in 1914, an increase of 400 million, in spite of the fact that many of the Western
            countries were opened to pioneers and that within 70 years more than 50 million persons
            from Europe alone migrated into the new lands. Each country in Europe contributed some
            of its surplus numbers to the <place>United States</place>, <place>Canada</place>,
                <place>South America</place> and <place>Australia</place>, but <del>in spite of
                this</del><add>Europe’s population</add> they grew more and more congested, and
            finally there was an explosion into the World War which nearly wiped out our
            civilization.</p>
        <p>Yet from 1910 on the German authorities were issuing statements of warning to the world
            that her population was increasing to the explosion point and her needs of expansion and
            land were dominating her every political and economic move. <person
                reg="von Bernhardi, Friedrich">General Bernhardi</person> in 1911 published the
            statement: “<q who="BERFR">Strong, healthy flourishing nations increase in numbers. From
                a given moment they require a continual expansion of their frontiers; they require
                new territory for the accomodation of their surplus population. Since almost every
                part of the globe is inhabited, new territory must be obtained at a cost to its
                possessors, that is to say, by conquest, which thus becomes a law of
            necessity</q>”.</p>
        <p>And more recently in 1936, <person reg="Goering, Hermann">General Goerring</person>
            issued the statement: “<q who="GOEHE">The territory in which the Germans live is too
                small for the 66 million inhabitants, and will soon be too small for the 70 million,
                80 million, 90 millions which we want to become</q>”.</p>
        <p><person reg="Mussolini, Benito">Mussolini</person>, in an address to the world a few
            years ago, said: “<q who="MUSBE">If <place>Italy</place> is to amount to anything she
                must enter into the second half of this century with a population of at least 60
                million inhabitants. We must at a given moment be able to mobilize 5 million men,
                thoroughly armed. We must strengthen our navy, while aviation must be on such a
                large scale and so powerful that the noise of its motors must surpass any other
                noise and the area of the wings of our aeroplanes must obscure the sun from our
                land. Then between 1935 and 1940 we will be able to make our voice heard</q>”.</p>
        <p>Italy has since spawned herself into conflict and the culture of the world is marking
            time until Europe comes to her senses and settles these disputes by a sound population
            policy for each nation. For there will be no permanent peace until these national
            population problems are solved, and the first and most important step to take towards
            their solution is to recognize that intelligent planning of population increase, among
            nations, is as essential to world peace and international welfare, as family planning is
            essential to the welfare and happiness of individuals.</p>
        <p>We have in our own United States a population of 130 million people (an increase of 30
            million since the birth control movement began in 1914.) There are about 45 million
            women of child-bearing age whose health and happiness depend upon proper knowledge of
            this function of child-bearing. This group is divided into two classes. One class has a
            knowledge of birth control, and the women in this group practice it successfully and are
            able to obtain and pay for such advice from the family physician.</p>
        <p>In the second and larger group the women also desire information, but can seldom get
            adequate or proper advice--<add>They</add> try everything and anything, and when failure
            is evident, often turn to the abortionist for the solution. We have been reading lately
            of discoveries by the police of notorious abortion “rings”. We know that these “rings”
            operate at great profit and in many cases menace the health and lives of women on whom
            these operations are performed. Over 8000 deaths a year represents a most conservative
            estimate. Yet the personal histories of these women often reveal the tragic conditions
            and desperate circumstances which led them to risk their health and very lives. Eminent
            authorities on the subject tell us that the rate of abortions to confinements has
            changed from 1 to 7 forty years ago, to 1 to 3 at the present time. Contrary to popular
            belief, 9 out of every 10 women who undergo abortions are married. The greatest increase
            in the number of abortions is noted primarily among mothers of three or more children.
            Abortion becomes therefore less a problem of morality than of economic necessity. Were
            contraceptive knowledge available and accessible to these women before pregnancy
            occurred, they would not go knocking on the doors of abortionists. Yet in <place>New
                York</place> State, it is still difficult for poverty-stricken women to obtain
            contraceptive knowledge on economic grounds. And so they seek the abortionist in
            despair. And the abortionist then becomes the evil that Society seeks to destroy, rather
            than applying intelligence to remove the causes that promote a demand for these
            services.</p>
        <p>Many of these women are poor<del>er</del>, more <add>are</add> inarticulate, <del>even
                less</del>
            <add>others</add>
            <add>in</add>accessible to any information, hopeless, poverty stricken, “always ailing,
            never failing,” hard working, frequently sharing with their husbands the task of earning
            enough to keep body and soul together. To me their lives are the great tragedies of our
            modern life. They are physically and economically, and often mentally, unfit to be
            mothers, yet they continue to constantly increase their families throughout their
            child-bearing years. Great hordes of these families try to eke out a living on farms, in
            camps, and on plantations. They are often classified as share-croppers, tenant farmers,
            or migrant workers. They huddle into camps or into areas where crops are to be picked,
            cut or crated. They earn from 50c to 80c a day when they work. The areas in which they
            live are called the “blighted areas”, where problems of poverty, high infant and
            maternal mortality, child labor, delinquency and truancy are largely found. These areas
            supply from 80% to 85% of the relief clients in these communities.</p>
        <p>These problems are not confined to any one locality but are fairly prevalent in every
            state in the Union. In particular the infant and maternal death rate is appalling yet
            nothing is done to provide these families with the knowledge whereby they could space
            their children or limit their families, saving both mothers and children. In these
            sections we find children born so close together that the mother has not had an
            opportunity to regain her strength from bearing one before another comes. The <org
                reg="United States Children's Bureau">Children’s Bureau</org> has provided the facts
            that prove what <del>a</del> knowledge of birth control applied to these groups could
            mean. Reports of the Childrens Bureau reveal that infant mortality is directly affected
            by the fathers income, and the place of the child in the family, <add>and the matter of
                spacing of births.</add> We know that of first born children, 22 out of 100 die,
            while of the 6th born, 29 die, and of the 12th born, 60 die. They tell us, moreover,
            that when children are born one year apart 147 out of a thousand die; when they are born
            two years apart 98 die, and when they are spaced three years apart only 86 die. These
            are the facts collected by the Children’s Bureau and yet they have not had the courage
            to extend birth control knowledge to save the lives and health of those they are
            dedicated to serve. Of the 2 million babies born in 1937, the mothers of a million had
            no nursing care after the birth of the babies, while a quarter million of these mothers
            had no doctors. Nearly 150,000 mothers and infants died last year, yet approximately 66%
            of these deaths were needless according to Dr. <person reg="Parran, Thomas">Thomas
                Parran</person>, Surgeon-General of the <org
                reg="United States Public Health Service">U.S. Public Health Service</org>. Our
            maternal mortality is among the highest and has not been decreased to any degree during
            the past 20 years.</p>
        <p>These are some of the tragic facts which arouse our indignation, knowing as we do from
            the reports received from the 485 birth control clinics in the country that mothers
            lives could be spared for their children and their families if they were given
            contraceptive advice before pregnancy occurs.</p>
        <p>This is the situation we must change if we are to take birth control down to those in the
            lowest economic strata of society. <place>Great Britain</place> has done it through her
                <org reg="Great Britian Ministry of Health">Ministry of Health</org> and through a
            network of approximately 3000 <org>Maternal and Infant Welfare Stations</org>, the
            mothers of England can obtain advice how to space, limit or control the size of
                    <del><gap extent="one word"/></del>their families (in accordance with the
            mother’s health, the father’s earning capacity, and the standard of living they wish to
            maintain).</p>
        <p>We should look upon birth control as a matter of social insurance not only for the health
            of the mother, the welfare of the children born, and unborn, but also as a protection
            for Society against the increase an multiplication of the unfit and mentally unstable.
            When our opponents say that these people in the lower economic brackets of society will
            not use birth control--that they are too lazy, too listless, careless or stupid--we can
            well reply: “Who has ever given them a chance? Has any effort ever been made to help
            them through birth control? We have hedged this knowledge about with taboos and
            restrictions, and made it as difficult and dangerous as possible for people to get it,
            so that for the most part only the upper strata with intelligence and means to buy this
            information have had access to it.</p>
        <p>Now thru Public Health agencies we should demand that this service be included and given
            to the underprivileged to enable them to help themselves. Only in this way can those
            unable to afford the services of private physicians secure this essential
            information.</p>
        <p>About ten years ago a group of <place reg="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</place> doctors,
            all noted men in their profession, presented a statement at the <org
                reg="Chicago Woman's Aid Society">Woman’s Aid Society</org> in that city.</p>
        <p>These eighteen doctors who signed the statement, wished to record their belief that “<q
                who="CD">it is wisdom &amp; justice to make legally available to any woman of
                legally marriagable age the knowledge to prevent conception.</q>” The statement
            concluded: “<q who="CD">Finally, we, as men, believe that if we had to undergo sickness,
                disfigurement, limitation of activities, discomfort, pain danger and sometimes death
                for the birth of a child, we would insist that it was our absolute right to choose
                our own time for the process. Therefore we believe this an essential and absolute
                right of women and encourage them to claim this right</q>”.</p>
        <p>This is a splendid attitude. The woman shall say “when” and the man shall say how
            many.</p>
        <p>The task now before us is to translate these good ideas into action. With the millions of
            dollars being spent for health and welfare for the masses, not one cent is allotted or
            allowed to be spent on contraceptive service for the people who can<add>not</add> afford
            to have children.</p>
        <p>The  Birth Control Federation of America is dedicated to help these women &amp;
            to free them from this unnecessary bondage.</p>
        <p>This new organization into which has been merged the two oldest birth control
            organizations has a destiny to fulfill. It has come into being at the psychological
            hour. . . .the hour has struck. This new federation is laying the cornerstone, yes the
            foundation, for the greatest experiment in race building the world has ever seen. For we
            are building not on environment, but on the quality of life itself. We want to encourage
            a new consciousness and personal responsibility in bringing a child into the world.
            There is no greater responsibility than that of passing on the gift of life. We want our
            young people who are to become parents to look upon their bodies as fit and perfect
            instruments in the service of the soul that shall inhabit that body in which it shall
            play its part in the mystery and consciousness of human evolution.</p>
