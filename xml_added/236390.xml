        <p>We are soon to witness the opening of the <org>New York World’s
                Fair</org> and will doubtless stand amazed at the progress that
            Science, Invention and Medicine have made during the past century.
            We shall find eloquent evidence that man has taken remarkable steps
            in the conquest of the external forces of Nature and has harnessed
            natural energies and controlled them for his own use. He has
            successfully spanned the ocean, flung railroads across continents,
            conquered the air, harnessed the endless torrents of water power.
            Through the lenses of his telescope he has explored distant
            universes. Through the lenses of his microscope he has waged war
            against germs and microbes. He has girded the globe in a fraction of
            a second with radio broadcasting. Everything has been accomplished
            in a desire to unite peoples and nations--to bring them closer
            together.</p>
        <p>Yet--because he has utterly neglected to control and direct that
            great creative force within human nature itself--the power of his
            own fertility--and has allowed ceaseless hordes of human beings to
            multiply and increase beyond their capacity to provide for
            themselves, we now find nations and peoples separated by hatred,
            bitterness and jealousies, and mankind goaded on to a frenzy of
            exploitation, aggression, arrogance and war.</p>
        <p>We now witness the conflict of two forces in nature--the slow growth
            of the mind and the high power of human fertility. One is of slow
            development, the other can multiply itself beyond the mind’s
            capacity to deal with it. It is this uncontrolled force, the results
            of which now screams to us across the world.</p>
        <p>The population of <place>Europe</place> which was 200 million in 1800
            rose to 600 million in 1914, an increase of 400 million, in spite of
            the fact that many of the Western countries were opened to pioneers
            and that within 70 years more than 50 million persons from Europe
            alone migrated into the new lands. Each country in Europe
            contributed some of its surplus numbers to the <place>United
                States</place>, <place>Canada</place>, <place>South
                America</place> and <place>Australia</place>, but <del>in spite
                of this</del><add>Europe’s population</add> they grew more and
            more congested, and finally there was an explosion into the World
            War which nearly wiped out our civilization.</p>
        <p>Yet from 1910 on the German authorities were issuing statements of
            warning to the world that her population was increasing to the
            explosion point and her needs of expansion and land were dominating
            her every political and economic move. <person
                reg="von Bernhardi, Friedrich">General Bernhardi</person> in
            1911 published the statement: “<q who="BERFR">Strong, healthy
                flourishing nations increase in numbers. From a given moment
                they require a continual expansion of their frontiers; they
                require new territory for the accomodation of their surplus
                population. Since almost every part of the globe is inhabited,
                new territory must be obtained at a cost to its possessors, that
                is to say, by conquest, which thus becomes a law of
                necessity</q>”.</p>
        <p>And more recently in 1936, <person reg="Goerring, Hermann">General
                Goerring</person> issued the statement: “<q who="GOEHE">The
                territory in which the Germans live is too small for the 66
                million inhabitants, and will soon be too small for the 70
                million, 80 million, 90 millions which we want to
            become</q>”.</p>
        <p><person reg="Mussolini, Benito">Mussolini</person>, in an address to
            the world a few years ago, said: “<q who="MUSBE">If
                    <place>Italy</place> is to amount to anything she must enter
                into the second half of this century with a population of at
                least 60 million inhabitants. We must at a given moment be able
                to mobilize 5 million men, thoroughly armed. We must strengthen
                our navy, while aviation must be on such a large scale and so
                powerful that the noise of its motors must surpass any other
                noise and the area of the wings of our aeroplanes must obscure
                the sun from our land. Then between 1935 and 1940 we will be
                able to make our voice heard</q>”.</p>
        <p>Italy has since spawned herself into conflict and the culture of the
            world is marking time until Europe comes to her senses and settles
            these disputes by a sound population policy for each nation. For
            there will be no permanent peace until these national population
            problems are solved, and the first and most important step to take
            towards their solution is to recognize that intelligent planning of
            population increase, among nations, is as essential to world peace
            and international welfare, as family planning is essential to the
            welfare and happiness of individuals.</p>
        <p>We have in our own United States a population of 130 million people
            (an increase of 30 million since the birth control movement began in
            1914.) There are about 45 million women of child-bearing age whose
            health and happiness depend upon proper knowledge of this function
            of child-bearing. This group is divided into two classes. One class
            has a knowledge of birth control, and the women in this group
            practice it successfully and are able to obtain and pay for such
            advice from the family physician.</p>
        <p>In the second and larger group the women also desire information, but
            can seldom get adequate or proper advice--<add>They</add> try
            everything and anything, and when failure is evident, often turn to
            the abortionist for the solution. We have been reading lately of
            discoveries by the police of notorious abortion “rings”. We know
            that these “rings” operate at great profit and in many cases menace
            the health and lives of women on whom these operations are
            performed. Over 8000 deaths a year represents a most conservative
            estimate. Yet the personal histories of these women often reveal the
            tragic conditions and desperate circumstances which led them to risk
            their health and very lives. Eminent authorities on the subject tell
            us that the rate of abortions to confinements has changed from 1 to
            7 forty years ago, to 1 to 3 at the present time. Contrary to
            popular belief, 9 out of every 10 women who undergo abortions are
            married. The greatest increase in the number of abortions is noted
            primarily among mothers of three or more children. Abortion becomes
            therefore less a problem of morality than of economic necessity.
            Were contraceptive knowledge available and accessible to these women
            before pregnancy occurred, they would not go knocking on the doors
            of abortionists. Yet in <place>New York</place> State, it is still
            difficult for poverty-stricken women to obtain contraceptive
            knowledge on economic grounds. And so they seek the abortionist in
            despair. And the abortionist then becomes the evil that Society
            seeks to destroy, rather than applying intelligence to remove the
            causes that promote a demand for these services.</p>
        <p>Many of these women are poor<del>er</del>, more <add>are</add>
            inarticulate, <del>even less</del>
            <add>others</add>
            <add>in</add>accessible to any information, hopeless, poverty
            stricken, “always ailing, never failing,” hard working, frequently
            sharing with their husbands the task of earning enough to keep body
            and soul together. To me their lives are the great tragedies of our
            modern life. They are physically and economically, and often
            mentally, unfit to be mothers, yet they continue to constantly
            increase their families throughout their child-bearing years. Great
            hordes of these families try to eke out a living on farms, in camps,
            and on plantations. They are often classified as share-croppers,
            tenant farmers, or migrant workers. They huddle into camps or into
            areas where crops are to be picked, cut or crated. They earn from
            50c to 80c a day when they work. The areas in which they live are
            called the “blighted areas”, where problems of poverty, high infant
            and maternal mortality, child labor, delinquency and truancy are
            largely found. These areas supply from 80% to 85% of the relief
            clients in these communities.</p>
        <p>These problems are not confined to any one locality but are fairly
            prevalent in every state in the Union. In particular the infant and
            maternal death rate is appalling yet nothing is done to provide
            these families with the knowledge whereby they could space their
            children or limit their families, saving both mothers and children.
            In these sections we find children born so close together that the
            mother has not had an opportunity to regain her strength from
            bearing one before another comes. The <org
                reg="United States Children's Bureau">Children’s Bureau</org>
            has provided the facts that prove what <del>a</del> knowledge of
            birth control applied to these groups could mean. Reports of the
            Childrens Bureau reveal that infant mortality is directly affected
            by the fathers income, and the place of the child in the family,
                <add>and the matter of spacing of births.</add> We know that of
            first born children, 22 out of 100 die, while of the 6th born, 29
            die, and of the 12th born, 60 die. They tell us, moreover, that when
            children are born one year apart 147 out of a thousand die; when
            they are born two years apart 98 die, and when they are spaced three
            years apart only 86 die. These are the facts collected by the
            Children’s Bureau and yet they have not had the courage to extend
            birth control knowledge to save the lives and health of those they
            are dedicated to serve. Of the 2 million babies born in 1937, the
            mothers of a million had no nursing care after the birth of the
            babies, while a quarter million of these mothers had no doctors.
            Nearly 150,000 mothers and infants died last year, yet approximately
            66% of these deaths were needless according to Dr. <person
                reg="Parran, Thomas">Thomas Parran</person>, Surgeon-General of
            the <org reg="United States Public Health Service">U.S. Public Health Service</org>. Our maternal mortality is among the
            highest and has not been decreased to any degree during the past 20
            years.</p>
        <p>These are some of the tragic facts which arouse our indignation,
            knowing as we do from the reports received from the 485 birth
            control clinics in the country that mothers lives could be spared
            for their children and their families if they were given
            contraceptive advice before pregnancy occurs.</p>
        <p>This is the situation we must change if we are to take birth control
            down to those in the lowest economic strata of society. <place>Great
                Britain</place> has done it through her <org
                reg="Great Britian Ministry of Health">Ministry of Health</org>
            and through a network of approximately 3000 <org>Maternal and Infant
                Welfare Stations</org>, the mothers of England can obtain advice
            how to space, limit or control the size of <del><gap
                    extent="one word"/></del>their families (in accordance with
            the mother’s health, the father’s earning capacity, and the standard
            of living they wish to maintain).</p>
        <p>We should look upon birth control as a matter of social insurance not
            only for the health of the mother, the welfare of the children born,
            and unborn, but also as a protection for Society against the
            increase an multiplication of the unfit and mentally unstable. When
            our opponents say that these people in the lower economic brackets
            of society will not use birth control--that they are too lazy, too
            listless, careless or stupid--we can well reply: “Who has ever given
            them a chance? Has any effort ever been made to help them through
            birth control? We have hedged this knowledge about with taboos and
            restrictions, and made it as difficult and dangerous as possible for
            people to get it, so that for the most part only the upper strata
            with intelligence and means to buy this information have had access
            to it.</p>
        <p>Now thru Public Health agencies we should demand that this service be
            included and given to the underprivileged to enable them to help
            themselves. Only in this way can those unable to afford the services
            of private physicians secure this essential information.</p>
        <p>About ten years ago a group of <place reg="Chicago, Illinois"
                >Chicago</place> doctors, all noted men in their profession,
            presented a statement at the <org reg="Chicago Woman's Aid Society">Woman’s Aid Society</org> in that
            city.</p>
        <p>These eighteen doctors who signed the statement, wished to record
            their belief that “<q who="CD">it is wisdom
                &amp; justice to make legally available to any woman of legally
                marriagable age the knowledge to prevent conception.</q>” The
            statement concluded: “<q who="CD">Finally, we,
                as men, believe that if we had to undergo sickness,
                disfigurement, limitation of activities, discomfort, pain danger
                and sometimes death for the birth of a child, we would insist
                that it was our absolute right to choose our own time for the
                process. Therefore we believe this an essential and absolute
                right of women and encourage them to claim this right</q>”.</p>
        <p>This is a splendid attitude. The woman shall say “when” and the man
            shall say how many.</p>
        <p>The task now before us is to translate these good ideas into action.
            With the millions of dollars being spent for health and welfare for
            the masses, not one cent is allotted or allowed to be spent on
            contraceptive service for the people who can<add>not</add> afford to
            have children.</p>
        <p>The<org>Birth Control Federation of America</org> is dedicated to
            help these women &amp; to free them from this unnecessary
            bondage.</p>
        <p>This new organization into which has been merged the two oldest birth
            control organizations has a destiny to fulfill. It has come into
            being at the psychological hour. . . .the hour has struck. This new
            federation is laying the cornerstone, yes the foundation, for the
            greatest experiment in race building the world has ever seen. For we
            are building not on environment, but on the quality of life itself.
            We want to encourage a new consciousness and personal responsibility
            in bringing a child into the world. There is no greater
            responsibility than that of passing on the gift of life. We want our
            young people who are to become parents to look upon their bodies as
            fit and perfect instruments in the service of the soul that shall
            inhabit that body in which it shall play its part in the mystery and
            consciousness of human evolution.</p>
