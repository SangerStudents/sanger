        <head type="sub">Advice available to those who find their post war problems are leading to
            separation, divorce</head>

        <q who="SHE"><p>War marriages made headlines right after <place reg="Pearl Harbor, HI">Pearl
                    Harbor</place>, when the marriage rate took a sharp up-swing. They are still
                making headlines, but they are no longer such cheerful ones. Two-thirds of the
                wartime marriages are doomed to end in the divorce courts, according to one
                prediction. Another more conservative estimate is that thirty-eight out of every one
                hundred will fail.</p>
            <p>How many of these marriages can really be salvaged? <person reg="Sanger, Margaret"
                    >Margaret Sanger</person>, whose courageous fight for birth control has made her
                name famous throughout the world, has some ideas on the subject which she sets forth
                in an article in <title>SHE Magazine</title>’s current issue.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger has no magic words of advice which can save the marriage born solely of
                war emotion and found in the sober light of afterthought to be completely wrong. But
                she does believe that with the proper effort and cooperation a great many war
                marriages otherwise destined to go on the rocks, can be saved. </p>
            <p>Women should realize that their soldier husbands have become distinct individuals,
                men who are tired of all restraints, apron strings, commands. The don’t want to be
                bossed, or even advised in many cases. Old occupations seem unbelievably dull and
                routine.</p>
            <p>Take the case of Mrs. Bill who became a successful business woman while her husband
                was fighting. She liked it. She didn’t dream Bill would be anything but proud and
                delighted. He wasn’t at all. He wanted her to quit, and was horrified and hurt at
                her earning more than he had at his pre-war job.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, both of them were willing to take advice and consulted Dr. <person
                    reg="Burr, Emily T.">Emily T. Burr</person>, Director of the <org
                    reg="New York City Vocational Adjustment Bureau">Vocational Adjustment
                    Bureau</org> of <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>. Dr. Burr
                suggested that Mrs. Bill continue on at her job but that Bill’s salary take care of
                all routine household expenses. Mrs. Bill could save for that baby they were
                planning to have as soon as they could afford it. This made sense to Bill and a
                quarrel that threatened to break Bill’s spirit and a splendid marriage was
                averted.</p>
            <p>On a train recently Mrs. Sanger talked with a young girl who carried a fretful baby.
                Her husband will return at the war’s end, but not to the appreciation he no doubt
                feels he deserves. She wants that appreciation for herself. She wants to be told how
                noble she has been to bear his child in that overcrowded hospital during his
                absence, to stay home with the baby night after night, scrimping on her allotment
                pay. After all, she argued, Phil was having plenty of excitement mixed in with the
                danger. Unless both give a little, and the girl-wife stops nursing her growing
                resentment, this particular marriage will be among the doomed.</p>
            <p>Frequently couples who have been married only a few weeks before they are separated
                tend to idealize each other during the period of separation, and are both completely
                disillusioned when faced with an average human being. When once they are made to
                realize this they are usually willing to let the other step down from the pedestal. </p>
            <p>Marriage is both a concession and a demand; a living thing that is never static, even
                during long absences. If one partner has had a chance to develop and grow, it is up
                to him or her to wait for the other to catch up.</p>
            <p>There are numerous organizations ready to serve the serviceman and to give expert
                advice. He should seek them out when problems seem too great to cope with. They may
                save a marriage!</p></q>
