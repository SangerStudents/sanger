        <p>A world in which <person reg="Franklin, Benjamin">Franklin</person>s, <person

            the mob.</p>
        <p>Imagine what the real or higher geniuses would be. A marvelous thought!</p>
        <p>An enchanting &amp; Glorious possibility. A <add>sure</add> &amp; great certainty we can
            make it come into realization. We have already begun.</p>
        <p>We control our destiny through knowledge &amp; Science. How shall we use this Power?</p>
        <p>Knowledge is the abolition of fear.</p>
        <p>Man is the only species on our globe (of the billions) to have risen to reason &amp;
            language thus leaving the others so far behind that the kinship between them is
            forgotten by all but a few superior minds.</p>
        <p>It takes great courage today for people who think to have children.</p>
        <p>The tradition that Fear created the gods. Primitive man read the existence the Divinity
            in Plagues, famines rather than in blessings.</p>
        <p>Priestly Power &amp; Ecclesiasticism is still present in this day and people resent the
            effort on its part to rule conjugal life in the name of Deity. </p>
        <p>All the ills and discords of humanity may be traced to one error--the indiscriminate and
            thoughtless use of life separated from intelligence. Some lives are like locomotives
            without an engineer.</p>
