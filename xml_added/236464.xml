        <p>In a democratic society where the vote of one is a good as that of another, it is a
            dangerous procedure to accept a way of life where the poor, ignorant, diseased and
            mentally and socially unfit maintain the stock of the population. Poverty and ignorance
            seem to be the factors to stimulate a high birth rate. We must abolish these factors as
            part of Sound National Population Planning. Increase pop for 1936 8,634,000.</p>
        <p>77% of the American people approve of B.C. as a part of our public health program.</p>
        <p>Gallup Poll</p>
        <p>Before we attempt to increase our own population and raise the birth rate, lets begin at
            the bottom and definitely cut down the birth rate of the feebleminded and mentally
            deficient -- cut down the increasing institutional population. This should be mandatory
            and those in charge made to answer for this. It has been secretly states at the <org
                reg="American Public Welfare Association">American Public Welfare Assn</org>. by
                <person reg="Haber, William">Wm Haber</person> Prof. of Economics at <org>University
                of Michigan</org> that 10% of the population 13,500,000 will continue on relief at a
            cost of $2,500,000,000 yearly to federal, state and local welfare bodies (tax payers).
            22,000,000 persons on relief in 1937. level it down to 14,000,000.</p>

        <p>It is not colonies, or disarmaments or new territory that is going to establish Peace in
                <place>Europe</place>. Just handing over colonies to any nation with a high birth
            rate simply postpones the crisis a generation &amp; with every nation in
                Europe
            <add>spawning</add> competition already unable to provide an outlet for their surplus
            population.</p>
        <p>The great pressure of surplus population is in <place>central Europe</place>. Within 100
            years 1800 to 1914 population of Europe increased from 180,000,000 to 480,000,000. At
            that period over 60,000,000 Europeans migrated to other continents about half came to
            the <place reg="United States">U States</place>.</p>
        <p>Since 1824 to 1930 immigration had practically closed in U.S.A. &amp; <place>South
                America</place> &amp; British Dominions. It was this decade that saw the explosion
            of <place>Italy</place> into <place>Ethiopia</place> &amp; <place>Germany</place> into
            Central Europe. With persecution and expropriation as National policies-- The end is not
            is sight.</p>
        <p>Mass emigration of Jews out of Germany or Central Europe is not the solution. It will
            need a new Continent with pioneer conditions &amp; natural resources to relieve the
            needs of Central Europe. To squeeze into a settled community this surplus will only
            react against the both native and alien groups--</p>
        <p>Is there such a continent? If so who will it up and does it mean Peace? If so how long?
            If the spawning competition of Central Europe <del>will</del> continues it is only
            another tomorrow before another continent will be needed &amp; demanded for the surplus
            population of that decade.</p>
        <p>It must be apparent to all Statesmen that the time has come to face the facts of
            population. It’s no use asking one nation to slow down their birth rates or armaments
            while other nations speed up their own-- It’s got to be all equal distribution of birth
            rights to inherit the <place>Earth</place> --</p>
