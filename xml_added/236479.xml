        <p>Another case--Perhaps the most tragic &amp; one which may already be too late to
            help--Fine young <add>age 29</add> woman mother of two children, husband known to be in
            prison captured in the <place reg="Bataan, Phillipines">Bataan</place> Crash two years
            ago came for the first year &amp; a half <add>after the news</add> this nerve taught
            girl was but a skeleton of her former self--pale, thin, restless (walking in her sleep)
            awakening <add><del>hopefully</del></add> only when news over the air came to give her
            hope of his safety &amp; release--Now this girl has fallen deeply in love with her
            husband’s friend--a man who also had been “over there” &amp; learned how to be ruthless
            &amp; to get what he wants--<emph rend="underline">regardless</emph>. The picture is not
            difficult to paint. This girl like millions of others has <del>not</del> lived the same
            life--the same home, food, meals, friends all that has been lacking was the love &amp;
            devoting of her husband to complete the cycle of her happiness along comes a sympathetic
            man who understands her heart ache who “clicks” in his reactions &amp; before they know
            it--There you are--some thing unforseen or planned has occurred--What to do? Wait--wait
            &amp; keep on waiting for the husbands to return. That is all a sensible girl can
            do--she must be made to see that he is sacrificing his very life that he has already
            given up the ordinary things she takes for granted--She too must just out of the <emph
                rend="underline">decency of life</emph> be willing to forego a seeming happiness,
            which may turn bitter as gall thru the years to come--when these children will ask
            “<q who="UNK">Mother <del><unclear>how</unclear></del> why did you let my Daddy down</q>”? Fortunately
            this girl has had a background which may in such a crisis bring out <add>the</add>
            loyalty &amp; integrity so necessary to support her marriage (sons) until her husband
            returns--when men return there may be the old glamour--heroism, Romance to click
            again.</p>
