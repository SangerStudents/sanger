        <head>Sexual Adjustment and Parenthood</head>
        <byline>by Margaret Sanger</byline>

        <p>Today's bride approaches marriage fortified with a thousand and one
            suggestions on conducting her wedding and running her home, but the
            chances are no one will tell her that most important thing of
            all--how to plan her family.</p>
        <p>The period of shyness and smirking over this vital concern has
            passed. We are able to face the fact that the rice thrown after the
            newlyweds isn't just an empty custom, but a symbol of fertility--a
            hope that the marriage will be blessed with issues. And it is now
            possible for the bride who wants to become acquainted with her
            husband and to grow accustomed to married life with all the
            complexities mixed with raptures, to plan her babies so they will be
            a joy rather than a health and economic hazard.</p>
        <p>Almost all of you want babies. It's a natural urge and fulfillment.
            And almost all of you, judging from the various polls, want the
            right to have your children when you want them and can best care for
            them.</p>
        <p>I have discussed the problem with several young girls, all interested
            in marriage, most of them prospective brides of the near future, to
            learn their reaction to so intimate a subject. One girl admitted,
            “All our bull sessions in college end up with sex. Although the kids
            think they know a lot, they really don't and would give anything for
            some definite advice and information.”</p>
        <p>Another said she believed all girls would like to know how to plan
            their families, but most of them “<q who="UNK">just don't know where
                to go to find out.</q>”</p>
        <p>There are excellent books available which can tell better than this
            short article the physiological and emotional factors involved in
            marriage. Among them is that perennial best-seller by Drs. <person
                reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer">Hannah</person> and <person
                reg="Stone, Abraham">Abraham Stone</person>, <title>Marriage
                Manual</title>. There is <title>The Happy Family</title> by Dr.
                <person reg="Levy, John">John Levy</person> and <person
                reg="Munroe, Ruth">Ruth Munroe</person>, Dr. <person
                reg="Butterfield, Oliver M.">Oliver M. Butterfield</person>'s
            useful pamphlet, <title>Marriage and Sexual Harmony</title> and
                <title>The Doctor Talks to the Bride</title> by Dr. <person
                reg="Levine, Lena">Lena Levine</person>.</p>
        <p>One thing all the wise men and women stress is that marriage should
            never be used for therapeutic purposes. Don't try to “cure” yourself
            or your fiance of some deep-seated psychic ailment by marriage. In
            the same manner, a husband and wife should not try to cement an
            otherwise unhappy marriage by having children. Children don't
            automatically “bring a couple together.” Too often, in a troubled
            atmosphere, the advent of children has the opposite effect.</p>
        <p>So be sure of yourself emotionally as well as physically before
            entering this serious state, particularly during these troubled war
            days. The fascination of the uniform, the urgencies of approaching
            separation and the desire to be patriotic can blind one to the
            realities of marriage.</p>
        <p>Know yourself and know the biology of what takes place when you are
            united with the man you love. Knowledge dispels the fears and
            shadows that too often sow the first seeds of disaster in marriage.
            Schools throughout the country are realizing the importance of
            teaching boys and girls about the functioning of their bodies.
            Almost every college and many high schools now include courses in
            sociology or marriage counselling to help young people make a
            success of this most important job of their lives.</p>
        <p>Army brides are finding aid through <org
                reg="United Service Organization">USO</org> and <org
                reg="Young Women's Christian Association">YWCA</org> services.
            Certain progressive ministers have inaugurated Family Groups,
            encouraging young people to gather for discussion of mutual
            problems.</p>
        <p>Frequently, troubled young people will ask marriage counsellors
            questions they wouldn't dream of asking those close to them, and
            will find relief in frank, impersonal advice. Two of the questions
            most frequently asked are: “Shall we go ahead and have a baby now or
            wait until after the war?” and “How can we learn to plan our
            family?”</p>
        <p>My answer to the first is, be a bride for a year, if possible, before
            having a baby. This will give you time to cement love and marriage,
            to make adjustments and prepare the atmosphere for the coming child.
            Of course this is difficult advice for the war bride, who must kiss
            the groom farewell after a few happy days. If she desires a child
            and feels herself physically, emotionally, and economically able to
            undertake the added burden in the face of her husband's uncertain
            return, let her go ahead. Many women are bearing infants happily and
            safely.</p>
        <p>Should you decide to go ahead and have a baby, go to your doctor for
            a thorough examination to be sure you are in the best possible
            physical condition, and continue under doctor's supervision until at
            least six weeks after the baby's birth.</p>
        <p>To the question, “Where shall I go to find out about child-spacing?”
            I can offer the reassurance that the <org>Planned Parenthood
                Federation of America</org> in <place reg="New York, NY">New
                York City</place> lists more than 786 child-spacing services
            throughout the country, as well as sterility services where those
            who find themselves unable to have children may be given aid. The
            Federation also has available the names of more than three thousand
            doctors qualified to give child-spacing information and the numerous
            methods of birth control. These must be prescribed individually by a
            physician trained in this branch of preventive medicine.</p>
        <p>There are five reasons for controlling parenthood which I feel cannot
            be stressed too often. First, no couple should have a child or
            anticipate one when either has a transmittable disease. Second, when
            a woman has a temporary disease which pregnancy affects, such as
            tuberculosis or kidney trouble, she should postpone her baby until
            this condition is either cured or safely arrested. Third, where the
            parents, although healthy, already have a child who is diseased or
            mentally deficient, there should be grave hesitation about bringing
            into the world another who might be so cursed.</p>
        <p>Fourth, where the spacing is incorrect, and children born too close
            together, the mortality statistics for both mother and child are
            great. You should enjoy your baby for at least a year before
            thinking of having another child. It's far better for your baby and
            for you, too.</p>
        <p>Fifth, if either you or your husband is extremely young, you should
            wait to mature both physically and mentally before having a child.
            This is fair not only to yourself but to your child, who deserves an
            adult parent in this complex world.</p>
        <p>Annually, many thousands of women die or are maimed from abortion and
            90 per cent of them are married women. Birth control information
            could have saved many of these lives. The number of abortions
            occurring each year range from 750 thousand to a million, and Dr.
                <person reg="Fishbein, Morris">Morris Fishbein</person>, editor
            of <title>The Journal of the <org>American Medical
                Association</org></title>, estimates that there has been a 20 to
            40 per cent increase since <place reg="Pearl Harbor, HI">Pearl
                Harbor</place>.</p>
        <p>It isn't fair to deny to the vast majority of women in this country
            the child-spacing knowledge they desire, and which is their
            democratic right. It isn't fair to force them, often, to the sad
            alternative of abortion.</p>
        <p>This is why I feel that you brides must know of these serious facts
            so that you can face marriage equipped with understanding and
            knowledge; that it is more important to tell you about planning your
            families then merely to give you details for making a wedding dress,
            or the best method for waxing your floors.</p>
