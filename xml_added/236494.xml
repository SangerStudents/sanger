        <byline>by <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p>Today's bride approaches marriage fortified with a thousand and one suggestions on
            conducting her wedding and running her home, but the chances are no one will tell her
            that most important thing of all--how to plan her family.</p>
        <p>The period of shyness and smirking over this vital concern has passed. We are able to
            face the fact that the rice thrown after the newlyweds isn’t just an empty custom, but a
            symbol of fertility--a hope that the marriage will be blessed with issues. And it is now
            possible for the bride who wants to become acquainted with her husband and to grow
            accustomed to married life with all the complexities mixed with raptures, to plan her
            babies so they will be a joy rather than a health and economic hazard.</p>
        <p>Almost all of you want babies. It’s a natural urge and fulfillment. And almost all of
            you, judging from the various polls, want the right to have your children when you want
            them and can best care for them.</p>
        <p>I have discussed the problem with several young girls, all interested in marriage, most
            of them prospective brides of the near future, to learn their reaction to so intimate a
            subject. One girl admitted, “<q who="UNK">All our bull sessions in college end up with
                sex. Although the kids think they know a lot, they really don’t and would give
                anything for some definite advice and information.</q>”</p>
        <p>Another said she believed all girls would like to know how to plan their families, but
            most of them “<q who="UNK">just don’t know where to go to find out.</q>”</p>
        <p>There are excellent books available which can tell better than this short article the
            physiological and emotional factors involved in marriage. Among them is that perennial
            best-seller by Drs. <person reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer">Hannah</person> and <person
                reg="Stone, Abraham">Abraham Stone</person>, <title type="book">Marriage
                Manual</title>. There is <title type="book">The Happy Family</title> by Dr. <person
                reg="Levy, John">John Levy</person> and <person reg="Munroe, Ruth">Ruth
                Munroe</person>, Dr. <person reg="Butterfield, Oliver M.">Oliver M.
                Butterfield</person>’s useful pamphlet, <title type="book">Marriage and Sexual
                Harmony</title> and <title type="book">The Doctor Talks to the Bride</title> by Dr.
                <person reg="Levine, Lena">Lena Levine</person>.</p>
        <p>One thing all the wise men and women stress is that marriage should never be used for
            therapeutic purposes. Don’t try to “cure” yourself or your fiance of some deep-seated
            psychic ailment by marriage. In the same manner, a husband and wife should not try to
            cement an otherwise unhappy marriage by having children. Children don’t automatically
            “bring a couple together.” Too often, in a troubled atmosphere, the advent of children
            has the opposite effect.</p>
        <p>So be sure of yourself emotionally as well as physically before entering this serious
            state, particularly during these troubled war days. The fascination of the uniform, the
            urgencies of approaching separation and the desire to be patriotic can blind one to the
            realities of marriage.</p>
        <p>Know yourself and know the biology of what takes place when you are united with the man
            you love. Knowledge dispels the fears and shadows that too often sow the first seeds of
            disaster in marriage. Schools throughout the country are realizing the importance of
            teaching boys and girls about the functioning of their bodies. Almost every college and
            many high schools now include courses in sociology or marriage counselling to help young
            people make a success of this most important job of their lives.</p>
        <p>Army brides are finding aid through <org reg="United Service Organization">USO</org> and
                <org reg="Young Women's Christian Association">YWCA</org> services. Certain
            progressive ministers have inaugurated Family Groups, encouraging young people to gather
            for discussion of mutual problems.</p>
        <p>Frequently, troubled young people will ask marriage counsellors questions they wouldn’t
            dream of asking those close to them, and will find relief in frank, impersonal advice.
            Two of the questions most frequently asked are: “<q who="UNK">Shall we go ahead and have
                a baby now or wait until after the war?” and “How can we learn to plan our
                family?</q>”</p>
        <p>My answer to the first is, be a bride for a year, if possible, before having a baby. This
            will give you time to cement love and marriage, to make adjustments and prepare the
            atmosphere for the coming child. Of course this is difficult advice for the war bride,
            who must kiss the groom farewell after a few happy days. If she desires a child and
            feels herself physically, emotionally, and economically able to undertake the added
            burden in the face of her husband’s uncertain return, let her go ahead. Many women are
            bearing infants happily and safely.</p>
        <p>Should you decide to go ahead and have a baby, go to your doctor for a thorough
            examination to be sure you are in the best possible physical condition, and continue
            under doctor’s supervision until at least six weeks after the baby’s birth.</p>
        <p>To the question, “<q who="UNK">Where shall I go to find out about child-spacing?</q>” I
            can offer the reassurance that the <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>
            in <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place> lists more than 786 child-spacing
            services throughout the country, as well as sterility services where those who find
            themselves unable to have children may be given aid. The Federation also has available
            the names of more than three thousand doctors qualified to give child-spacing
            information and the numerous methods of birth control. These must be prescribed
            individually by a physician trained in this branch of preventive medicine.</p>
        <p>There are five reasons for controlling parenthood which I feel cannot be stressed too
            often. First, no couple should have a child or anticipate one when either has a
            transmittable disease. Second, when a woman has a temporary disease which pregnancy
            affects, such as tuberculosis or kidney trouble, she should postpone her baby until this
            condition is either cured or safely arrested. Third, where the parents, although
            healthy, already have a child who is diseased or mentally deficient, there should be
            grave hesitation about bringing into the world another who might be so cursed.</p>
        <p>Fourth, where the spacing is incorrect, and children born too close together, the
            mortality statistics for both mother and child are great. You should enjoy your baby for
            at least a year before thinking of having another child. It’s far better for your baby
            and for you, too.</p>
        <p>Fifth, if either you or your husband is extremely young, you should wait to mature both
            physically and mentally before having a child. This is fair not only to yourself but to
            your child, who deserves an adult parent in this complex world.</p>
        <p>Annually, many thousands of women die or are maimed from abortion and 90 per cent of them
            are married women. Birth control information could have saved many of these lives. The
            number of abortions occurring each year range from 750 thousand to a million, and Dr.
                <person reg="Fishbein, Morris">Morris Fishbein</person>, editor of <title
                type="journal">The Journal of the <org>American Medical Association</org></title>,
            estimates that there has been a 20 to 40 per cent increase since <place
                reg="Pearl Harbor, HI">Pearl Harbor</place>.</p>
        <p>It isn’t fair to deny to the vast majority of women in this country the child-spacing
            knowledge they desire, and which is their democratic right. It isn’t fair to force them,
            often, to the sad alternative of abortion.</p>
        <p>This is why I feel that you brides must know of these serious facts so that you can face
            marriage equipped with understanding and knowledge; that it is more important to tell
            you about planning your families then merely to give you details for making a wedding
            dress, or the best method for waxing your floors.</p>
