        <head type="sub">(Sent to Hastings &amp; Mrs. Salomon)</head>
        <p>The best minds of the country are engaged in leading <place
                reg="United States of America">America</place> out of the
            depression. The causes underlying our present difficulties are many
            and complex, and there is no one panacea which will take us back
            into the land of plenty, but some things are clear and some things
            can be done at once.</p>
        <p> Recently issued figures of high birth rates in families on relief,
            as compared with families of similar social status among the
            employed, point to a moral which we should lose no time in acting
            upon.</p>
        <p> Each year since 1930 the cost of relief has practically doubled, and
            the end is not yet. Population in America today may not be pressing
            upon the means of subsistence, as <person
                reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert">Malthus</person> fore-told that it
            might and could, but population is certainly pressing upon our
            relief funds. Eleven million people are unemployed, and the official
                <org reg="Federal Emergency Relief Administration"> FERA </org>
            figures for February, 1935, show 4,485,000 families on general
            relief. It is in these four million families that the birth rate is
            the highest, that from 45 to 60% more babies are born than in
            families which are fortunate enough still to be independent or
            employed.</p>
        <p> Cold hard logic, dollars and cents, taxes and survival, point to
            giving the mothers in these families of the poor access to reliable
            birth control information. But this is not all. Public health, the
            quality, both physically and mentally, of the next generation, which
            will make the America of tomorrow, demands that people be given the
            knowledge of how to avoid unwanted children, of how to plan their
            families and space their children.</p>
        <p> Last, but not least, there is the factor of human happiness. I need
            not tell this audience of the tragedies inherent in ignorance of
            birth control. I need not wring your hearts with tales of lives
            warped and broken, sickness and death which might have been avoided,
            had poor women been able to secure this necessary medical
            information.</p>
        <p> Population is pressing on relief facilities, and upon the very
            structure of our social system, upon education, culture, and all
            that we have painfully built up, in trying to make our children’s
            world a better one than ours.</p>
        <p> Let us face the fact that unemployment is not a temporary condition.
            The increasing development and use of machinery in production is a
            most significant factor. There will continue to be less and less
            need for human labor, as we invent new and better mechanical
            devices. Shall we stop inventions and the development of science, or
            shall we adjust our population to the needs of our modern world.</p>
        <p> The obsolete <title type="law">Comstock laws</title>, which have
            been on our statute books since 1873, make us the laughing stock of
            the civilized countries. We are the only country in the world which
            classes contraception with obscenity. Help us amend these laws. Help
            me make it possible for doctors, hospitals, public health agencies
            to lawfully give to the women of America the birth control
            instruction they so greatly need. </p>
