        <p>The best minds of the country are engaged in leading <place reg="United States"
                >America</place> out of the depression. The causes underlying our present
            difficulties are many and complex, and there is no one panacea which will take us back
            into the land of plenty, but some things are clear and some things can be done at
            once.</p>
        <p> Recently issued figures of high birth rates in families on relief, as compared with
            families of similar social status among the employed, point to a moral which we should
            lose no time in acting upon.</p>
        <p> Each year since 1930 the cost of relief has practically doubled, and the end is not yet.
            Population in America today may not be pressing upon the means of subsistence, as
                <person reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert">Malthus</person> fore-told that it might and
            could, but population is certainly pressing upon our relief funds. Eleven million people
            are unemployed, and the official <org
                reg="United States Federal Emergency Relief Administration"> FERA </org> figures for
            February, 1935, show 4,485,000 families on general relief. It is in these four million
            families that the birth rate is the highest, that from 45 to 60% more babies are born
            than in families which are fortunate enough still to be independent or employed.</p>
        <p> Cold hard logic, dollars and cents, taxes and survival, point to giving the mothers in
            these families of the poor access to reliable birth control information. But this is not
            all. Public health, the quality, both physically and mentally, of the next generation,
            which will make the America of tomorrow, demands that people be given the knowledge of
            how to avoid unwanted children, of how to plan their families and space their
            children.</p>
        <p> Last, but not least, there is the factor of human happiness. I need not tell this
            audience of the tragedies inherent in ignorance of birth control. I need not wring your
            hearts with tales of lives warped and broken, sickness and death which might have been
            avoided, had poor women been able to secure this necessary medical information.</p>
        <p> Population is pressing on relief facilities, and upon the very structure of our social
            system, upon education, culture, and all that we have painfully built up, in trying to
            make our childrenâ€™s world a better one than ours.</p>
        <p> Let us face the fact that unemployment is not a temporary condition. The increasing
            development and use of machinery in production is a most significant factor. There will
            continue to be less and less need for human labor, as we invent new and better
            mechanical devices. Shall we stop inventions and the development of science, or shall we
            adjust our population to the needs of our modern world.</p>
        <p> The obsolete <name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Comstock
                laws</name>, which have been on our statute books since 1873, make us the laughing
            stock of the civilized countries. We are the only country in the world which classes
            contraception with obscenity. Help us amend these laws. Help me make it possible for
            doctors, hospitals, public health agencies to lawfully give to the women of America the
            birth control instruction they so greatly need. </p>
