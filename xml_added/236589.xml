        <p>In 1914, after my challenge to the <org><place>United States</place> Government</org> on
            the legality of birth control, I went to <place>Europe</place> to study the movement
            there and build up a convincing defense for my coming trial. I went first to
                <place>England</place>. It was during my arduous research in the <org>British
                Museum</org> that a study of the birth and death rates of European countries
            revealed to me that <place reg="Netherlands">Holland</place> stood out as the one nation
            where some force was automatically at work on what seemed to me constructive race
            building.</p>
        <p>I soon became convinced that I must go to Holland and dig out facts not only from records
            but from personal observation. Shortly after my first visit to the <org
                reg="Malthusian League">Neo-Malthusian headquarters</org> in <place
                reg="London, England">London</place> I decided to visit Holland. Both <person
                reg="Drysdale, Charles Vickery">Dr.</person> and <person
                reg="Drysdale, Bessie Ingham">Mrs. Drysdale</person> were most helpful in giving me
            letters of introduction to various people, principally Dr. <person reg="Jacobs, Aletta"
                >Aletta Jacobs</person> of <place reg="Amsterdam, Netherlands">Amsterdam</place> and
            Dr. <person reg="Rutgers, Johannes">Johannes Rutgers</person> of The Hague.</p>
        <p>In those early days I never stopped to fill my head with details. I did not write to
            anyone in Holland to inquire if either Dr. Jacobs or Dr. Rutgers was there. I just
            decided to go over to Holland and look the ground over carefully. Perhaps there at last
            I would find the answer to the many problems constantly popping into my brain the deeper
            I probed into the question of birth control.</p>
        <p>The war was in its first phase. Passports and visas were important. Already the blockade
            was threatened. To cross the Channel meant possible encounters with floating bombs,
            submarines, and all kinds of inconveniences and delays. It was no wonder that friends
            begged me to remain in London and to postpone my visit to the <place reg="Europe"
                >Continent</place> until things were more settled. For me this was impossible; I was
            out to search for knowledge and facts. My <person reg="Sanger, Stuart"><person
                    reg="Sanger, Grant"><person reg="Sanger, Peggy"
                >children</person></person></person> were awaiting my return home. I could not allow
            possible war difficulties to hold me back from the goal I had set out to reach.</p>
        <p>Early in the morning of a cold January day in 1915 I arrived at <place
                reg="The Hague, Netherlands">The Hague</place>. At the small hotel where I
            registered the guests were gathered <foreign rend="underline" lang="FRE">en famille</foreign> at a
            long table and breakfasting on black bread, cheese and coffee. Speaking neither Dutch
            nor German, I could only sit and watch.</p>
        <p>For the same reason I could not telephone to Dr. Rutgers. So at nine o'clock the same
            morning, I write his address on a piece of paper, hailed a taxi and set forth to call on
            the veteran of Dutch Neo-Malthusianism. Never shall I forget the feeling I had when, in
            response to my ring, a small, square aperture in the upper part of the door opened in an
            uncanny way, and a face, wizened, aged and inquisitive, appeared in the frame window.
            Finally, after I had explained my mission, the doctor himself opened the door. I was
            ushered into his library to wait until he was dressed. We then went out to a second
                “breakfast” together at a nearby cafe, where we talked about
            the sitution in Holland and the difficulties in America until noon.</p>
        <p>From Dr. Rutgers I learned much of the complexities of the technique of contraception. He
            suggested that I learn his technique in adjusting the Mensinga pessary. The following
            day, accordingly, I began my daily visits to his office which I continued for several
            weeks. Under his tutelage, I began to realize the importance of individual instruction
            for each woman if the method advised was to benefit her. Fortunately, my knowledge of
            anatomy and physiology stood me in good stead for learning this quickly.</p>
        <p>To my surprise, I found over fifteen different kinds of devices in use as contraceptives,
            and fourteen sizes of the diaphragm, or Mensinga pessary adopted and generally
            recommended in Holland. The fact that each woman had to be examined by Dr. Rutgers
            before the method of contraception could be advised, presented an entirely new aspect of
            the question to me. I began to delve into the whys and wherefores with deep interest. I
            bombarded the little man with questions concerning each case. At some sessions there
            were as many as ten or even fifteen women in his office for instruction.</p>
        <p>Besides myself, two midwives were learning the technique from Dr. Rutgers. They came each
            morning to equip themselves with knowledge preparatory to starting a center in the
            outskirts of The Hague. There were already over fifty such centers, which Dr. Rutgers
            called “clinics”. This name was given to the fifty consultation centers which at that
            time had been organized and were being supported by the <org reg="Nieuw-Malthusiaansche Bond">Dutch Neo-Malthusian
                League</org>, established in 1881. The nurses or midwives were trained by Dr.
            Rutgers as experts in hygienic methods of family limitation. They were then set up in
            practice in various towns or cities throughout Holland. </p>
        <p>After the morning’s work at the doctor’s office, I would wander about the city looking
            into shops where supplies were sold, which at that time carried window displays. I spent
            hours studying in the libraries and in the <org
                reg="Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics">Central Bureau of Statistics</org>. I
            employed a translator to help me obtain the facts and figures on Holland’s birth and
            death rates, infant mortality, legitimate and illegitimate fertility, child labor, and
            wages, over the period of years from the establishment of the first birth control clinic
            in 1878 by Dr. Aletta Jacobs to the year 1914. </p>
        <p>The facts were illuminating and the conclusions revealing. I felt aglow with fresh
            enthusiasm as the results of a controlled and directed birth rate were shown from data
            to be as beneficial as I had conceived they might be. </p>
        <p>I found that birth control information had been more widely disseminated among the mass
            of the people in Holland than in any other country in the world, thanks to that great
            humanitarian, Dr. Rutgers, and the Dutch Malthusian League under his leadership. His
            service to the movement in the development of clinics and in directing the teachings of
            family limitation into homes where there was poverty, or disease, cannot be
            overestimated. I found that the infant mortality rates of The Hague and Amsterdam were
            at that time the lowest of all cities in the world, while the general and infant death
            rates of Holland were the lowest of all European countries. <place>New Zealand</place>
            was the only country in the world that could boast of a higher record in the saving of
            lives. </p>
        <p>After my arrival in Holland I had sent a note to Dr. Aletta Jacobs, the first woman
            doctor in Holland, founder of the first birth control clinic in that country (or in any
            country), requesting the honor and the privilege of an interview with her at any time
            convenient after my arrival in Amsterdam. I wrote her that I intended to make a full
            study of the subject while in her country, and complimented her on the brave stand she
            had taken, many details of which I had but recently gathered from Dr. Rutgers. A reply
            came. She refused to see me, and stated bluntly that she did not wish to have anything
            to do with me or my studies; that it was not for “laymen” to
            interfere in this work; it was a doctor’s subject, and only professional men and women
            should take it up. I was surprised, of course, and hurt as much as I could be hurt in
            those days, for I seemed to be one mass of aches, physically, mentally and spiritually,
            all the day long. I went to bed sore in heart and soul, and awakened to start another
            day of aches, so that Dr. Jacobs’ letter was just one more sting to an already numbed
            condition. </p>
        <p>To do her justice, I want to say that in 1925, when she attended the <org
                type="conference">Sixth International Birth Control Conference</org> in <place
                reg="New York, NY">New York</place> at my invitation and as my guest, she took me
            aside one day and apologized for her letter and behavior, and moreover congratulated me
            for the advance the cause had made through what she was pleased to term my “impersonal
            leadership.” </p>
        <p>After finishing my course of study at The Hague, I went to Amsterdam and <place
                reg="Rotterdam, Netherlands">Rotterdam</place> and visited many of the clinics and
            the independent nurses, many of whom had been trained by Dr. Rutgers. It was my good
            fortune in Amsterdam to meet <person reg="deBeer-Meijers, Clara">Mme. de Beer
                Meijers</person>, an active Neo-Malthusian, who spoke English fluently and gave me
            much personal assistance in taking me to the various clinics. </p>
        <p>Mme. de Beer-Meijers was to organize, a few years later, the Amsterdam conference on
            contraceptives, when Dr. and Mrs. Drysdale and Dr. <person reg="Haire, Norman"
                >Haire</person> from London and I met with the Dutch and German leaders. To her is
            due the success of that conference. One of its most enlightening features was the visit
            to the Amsterdam clinics when Mme. de Beer-Meijers made explanations in English and
            interpreted for us. </p>
        <p>My visit to Holland was early in January. I remained there until the end of February,
            when I was finally able to secure passage on a small freighter, the first which was to
            test out the blockade across the English Channel. We left Amsterdam one evening and
            arrived in London three days later, a journey that usually takes but one night. </p>
        <p>This trip to Holland revolutionized my ideas regarding the future of the movement. No
            longer could I look upon birth control knowledge as essentially a free speech fight. I
            realized now that it involved much more than talk, much more than books or pamphlets no
            matter how widely or freely one might wish to spread pamphlets containing this
            information. That was not enough. Personal instruction must depend upon physiological
            and anatomical knowledge. Only persons equipped with such knowledge could instruct
            properly and safely. </p>
        <p>Now that I was convinced of this, a new field lay before me, and one far more difficult
            to travel, viz., to direct and educate the public to demand from the medical profession,
            safe, reliable information, and to arouse and awaken the same profession to the
            importance of their having such knowledge to give. This has been a long, hard road, and
            the end has not yet been reached fifteen years later. </p>
        <p>In 1921 after the Dutch Neo-Malthusian League’s old, conservative officers had come into
            conflict with the new, younger groups whose ideas were influenced by the wave of freedom
            spreading from <place>Russia</place>, Dr. Rutgers wrote me as follows:</p>
        <p rend="blockquote">The year 1920 was a difficult one for the Dutch Neo-Malthusian League.
            The general meeting at <place reg="Utrecht, Netherlands">Utrecht</place> in April
            disapproved the tactics of the Board of Directors, and a new one was formed.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote"><lb/>The new Board of Directors is more democratic; every member does
            his own work in order that more can be done in the future for propaganda.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote"><lb/>The number of members of the League was 6,418 on the first of
            January, 1921. </p>
        <p rend="blockquote"><lb/>Many physicians asked for and received a report telling all about
            the League.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote"><lb/>There are in Holland fifty-four clinics, with eight doctors and
            fifty-six nurses, the latter trained by doctors.</p>
        <p rend="blockquote"><lb/>More than 1,000 persons have asked yearly for information.
            Consultation is gratis. The usual charge for articles advised is about five guilders per
            person. When they can prove that the charge is too much, the League will pay partly or
            wholly....</p>
        <p>I visited Dr. Rutgers again in 1920, and found a sad and unhappy man, ever willing that
            the younger generation should try its hand but realizing how much they were lacking in
            experience. The following year he was unable, on account of his health, to join us at
            the <org reg="conference">Amsterdam Conference on Contraceptives</org>. His death in
            1924 was ten years too soon. Today the influence of his work goes on spreading itself
            sanely, quietly into the lives of people who are not afraid to think. </p>
        <p>The results of my first visit to Holland were to change the whole course of the birth
            control movement, not only in America but in England as well. </p>
