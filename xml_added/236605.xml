        <p>COMRADES AND FRIENDS,---.</p>
        <p>In closing this series of pamphlets on <title type="book">"Methods of Birth
                Control</title>," I wish to express my thanks to all those who have written me
            letters of encouragement and appreciation during the past several months, and also to
            those who have come to the aid of <person reg="Sanger, William">Mr. Sanger</person> in
            the defence against his outrageous arrest by <person reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony
                Comstock</person>.</p>
        <p>In the first issue of the <title type="journal">Woman Rebel</title>, I promised to give
            to my subscribers the information to prevent conception. Even though seven issues out of
            nine were suppressed and confiscated, and three indictments returned against me, I have
            succeeded in doing what I was determined to do, and what I was convinced was my duty to
            do if I was to call myself <emph rend="italics">a woman</emph>.</p>
        <p>I lay no claim to pioneering in the Birth Control movement in <place reg="United States"
                >America</place>. The industrial and economic conditions had done all the pioneering
            which was done in America, and especially among the working people; but as soon as I was
            convinced that the information to prevent conception was a necessity for woman's as well
            as man's emancipation, I set to work at once to do my part in giving it.</p>
        <p>When any one man or woman knows the evils which the lack of this knowledge causes to
            society, and, knowing it, fails to give it because a criminal law forbids it, to me such
            a person is a coward, and should be branded as such. But as a real fact even doctors and
            nurses have known no other methods of prevention than the condom and withdrawal. The
            question has had very little discussion in medical circles. In my past year in America I
            have had many doctors confess their ignorance of other methods.</p>
        <p>That the <org reg="New York Academy of Medicine">Academy of Medicine in New York
                City</org> came out for Birth Control a few months ago gives hope for discussion on
            the subject, and perhaps for newer and better methods of Birth Control than are at
            present known in other countries. At least we know that an interest has been aroused in
            the subject, and if anything I have done has in any way contributed in arousing this
            great interest, I can only say that sacrifices, sufferings, worry, and misunderstandings
            of the past year recede into the background at the joy this thought gives me.</p>
        <p>The question now comes to me as I finish this work, shall I return to America to take up
            the fight with the Government, or shall I remain in <place>England</place> and continue
            my work unmolested here? It has been difficult to decide, but the feeling within me is
            that my work is not done until I have the liberty of conducting a Birth Control clinic
            in <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>, just as free from Government
            interference as I can conduct one in London. This feeling has prompted me to return. I
            hope to establish a free clinic in the Lower East Side in New York, where poor women can
            come for advice and instruction concerning Birth Control.</p>
        <p>Of course, this cannot be done until the indictments now pending against me are
            dismissed.</p>
        <p>I call upon you all to help in this fight, <emph rend="italics">one of the most important
                for woman's freedom ever waged</emph>. Mr. Sanger has been refused a jury trial, and
            his case comes up before three judges, who will in a few days decide his case.</p>
        <p>One word more in closing. After the suspension of the <title rend="italics">Woman
                Rebel</title>, all money orders which I received for subscriptions after December 1,
            1914, were returned to sender. Kindly look into the matter if you have not received it,
            and let me know.</p>
        <p>Again accept my thanks, and join hands with me in this fight for a free and intelligent
            humanity.</p>
        <closing>Fraternally, <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET H. SANGER</person>.
                Address:--<org>Free Speech League</org>, 241 East 201st Street, New York
            City.</closing>
