        <head>Population - Everybody's Business</head>
        <byline>By Margaret Sanger</byline>
        <head type="sub"> Control of the Birthrate a Necessary Consideration in
            Peace Building</head>
        <p>Population is a dull technical word that unfortunately means little
            to the average man. He knows when the birth rate rises sharply or
            drops sharply because he sees this fact either lauded or deplored in
            the public press. But the problems of population he is willing to
            leave to the experts, feeling that they don't concern him at all.
            The idea that population is actually himself has never occurred to
            him; the idea that population problems are a factor in having caused
            the war he is fighting would doubtless baffle or possibly even amuse
            him.</p>
        <p>In his vague concern over <q>postwar plans</q>, he doesn't realize that an
            intelligent population policy for the world is one of the things
            that may keep his son out of a war like the present, only far worse,
            because modern ingenuity figures out each year more and deadlier
            means of killing human beings. Population control can contribute to
            your happiness, security and prosperity, on the one hand, just as
            lack of it must inevitably result in poverty, famine and--too
            often--war.</p>
        <p>If somehow the little man could be made to realize the importance to
            himself and his family of that vague word <q>population</q>, peace might
            come nearer to realization in our time.</p>
        <p>One thing is certain, global war must be followed by global peace.
            The gains we are struggling to achieve in this country must be
            expanded throughout the world if they are to be effective for us and
            future generations. In the <place>United States</place> we have
            achieved a favorable balance between population and resources which
            has contributed greatly to the raising of our national standard of
            living. But it will avail us little in the long run if European and
            Asiatic countries and some of our own possessions continue to
            overrun their boundaries and their resources and to breed themselves
            into greater poverty, famine, and many of them ultimately into war.
            Therefore, it is time that the planning and intelligent limitation
            of populations become the concern of the world.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to think in world terms, so I would like to consider
            the case for world population control through the eyes of the one
            nearest us, the solider son, or husband, or brother, Private Jones,
            who will return, when his job is finished, to his wife and their
            future. Specifically, what does our world hold for him and
            particularly for that hope of our future, his child?</p>
        <p>Since we are reducing population to one family, let us see how the
            Joneses are solving their “problem.” Mrs. Jones has been working in
            a defense factory to augment her slender allotment pay. Fortunately
            she chose one with a liberal maternal health policy, so when she
            became pregnant she was not immediately fired but put at a lighter
            task and eventually given time off with no loss of seniority to have
            her baby. Being a <person reg="member of United States armed forces">GI</person> wife, she had a GI baby--that is, the
            government paid for her prenatal care, delivery and postpartum care.
            Again being fortunate, she has been able to leave the baby at a
            nursery conveniently located near the factory. The government paid
            for pediatric care during the child's first year. Mrs. Jones has no
            parents or other relatives to whom she could turn: this is the case
            with so many young women during these days of family
            dislocation.</p>
        <p>The time comes for young Jones to be mustered out of the army. He
            needs care and treatment before entering the competitive business
            world again. He must rest after the magnificent and arduous job he
            has helped to do. So it's better for his wife to remain a little
            longer at the job. It is very important even that she postpone the
            next desired baby until her veteran husband is on his feet again and
            able to take his proper place as head of the family.</p>
        <p>In <place reg="United States of America">America</place> Mrs. Jones will find
            medical assistance in child spacing available to her in all states
            but <place>Massachusetts</place> and <place>Connecticut</place>. If
            she lives in one of eight southern states, she may go to the public
            health maternity centers for this advice. There are child spacing
            services and more then 3000 referral doctors throughout the country
            with which she may make contact by writing to the <org
                reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned
                Parenthood Federation</org> at 501 Madison Avenue in <place reg="New York, NY">New York
            City</place>. The number of clinic services is still limited to 600, so that
            in spite of the fact that the knowledge is available it is estimated
            that 13,000,000 married people in this country still lack access to
            child spacing advice. Mrs. Jones is one of the fortunate ones who
            have been able to adjust their own population problems: she can keep
            things going until her husband has found himself and become adjusted
            to his job again. When he has, she'll go right ahead with that
            family they've planned, for like most human beings in the world Mr.
            and Mrs. Jones love children and have the human urge to produce as
            many as they can care for. Our all time high birth rate of more than
            3,000,000 babies for 1943 is testimony to the strength of the
            reproductive urge.</p>
        <p>The colored American private, returning to his wife, doesn't face
            quite such a bright future. He may not know it in cold figures, but
            the death rate for his race in the United States is 50 per cent
            higher than that of whites. His wife, when she faces maternity, will
            run double the risk of the white mother in this country, and his
            infant is subjected to the even greater risk of a death rate one and
            a half times that of a white baby. In fact, 40,000 Negro babies die
            every year, of our 13,000,000 Negro population. So it is even more
            important that this American who has been fighting to uphold
            democracy be given the right to plan his family, space his babies
            and have them when the health of his wife permits and when he will
            be best able to care for them.</p>
        <p>The Puerto Rican soldier is also an American citizen. Induction into
            the army has meant a life of square meals for him, of living
            conditions on his native island beyond his wildest dreams. For very
            little has been done about the fact that tiny <place>Puerto
                Rico</place>, an island 100 miles long by 35 or 40 miles wide,
            supports about 2,000,000 people, with from 33,000 to 40,000 new ones
            being added each year. Since the island can't be stretched and war
            has kept the people from emigrating, and since American health and
            sanitation measures have lowered death rates just sufficiently to
            produce an added population boost, conditions become progressively
            worse in this American possession. Pedro, together with about
            250,000 others, lives in a slum indescribable in filth. His children
            are among the 200,000 without any schooling. His young daughter was
            one of the many girls seen in the streets of <place
                reg="San Juan, Puerto Rico">San Juan </place>at night offering
            themselves to our soldiers to obtain food; then Pedro was taken into
            the army and able to send his allotment home.</p>
        <p>Pedro and his people have cost the American taxpayers $247,000,000 in
            relief money during the past eight years and will cost them much
            more in the future unless some drastic measure is taken to adjust
            population at least to living space.</p>
        <p>Although birth control has been made available to Puerto Rican
            citizens, the work is hampered by religious opposition, by legal
            restrictions. In addition, a vast educational campaign is needed to
            make those parents who need it most aware of its efficacy and
            importance to their happiness and well-being.</p>
        <p>Farther from home and in even sharper contrast to our soldier is
            Private Rami of <place>India</place>, who volunteered and is now
            returning from fighting for the Allied cause. What does he face in
            his native land after the great struggle is finally over? He lives
            in <place reg="Bengal, India">Bengal</place>, where his allotment of
            rice has decreased sharply because in his particular district there
            are more than 2000 people per square mile. Rami does not know this
            in statistical form but in the pinched feeling of his stomach, in
            the hungry eyes of his babies, and in the sad expression of his
            wife, who knows that with his return there will be more mouths to
            feed on the pitifully small amount of food that comes to them. Rami
            has heard that prospects are a little better for himself and his
            family, that health measures have improved. But he doesn't realize
            that without the knowledge of how to space his babies this will
            merely mean more babies kept alive to be fed; more human beings to
            starve in the next inevitable famine. He accepts famine as the
            natural order of things in a land of 403,000,000--one fifth of the
            world's population squeezed into an area only 60 per cent of the
            size of the United States. Since 1876 periodic famines and the 1918
            influenza epidemic have wiped out more than 15,000,000 Indians. Rami
            accepts famine as the Chinese do.</p>
        <p>Rami is so accustomed to death that he might not be horrified to
            learn that during a recent year when only 48 American babies per
            thousand died, more than three times that number, 167 little Indian
            babies, were sacrificed. Rami is too busy trying to wrest a meager
            existence from the soil to worry about the shortness of his life
            expectancy, but the statistician could tell him that his offspring
            will have a brief life expectancy of 27 years as compared with the
            64 years which are the life outlook for a baby born in the United
            States.</p>
        <p>There isn't much in life for him anyway but work and worry about his
            family, so why should it be prolonged?</p>
        <p>Sir <person reg="Megaw, John">John Megaw</person>, ex-Director
            General of the <org>Indian Medical Service</org>, has stated with
            regard to the problem in India:</p>
        <p>“<q who="MEGJO">Suppose for a moment the public health services of
                India were to achieve a complete success in stamping out
                malaria, cholera, smallpox, tuberculosis and all other great
                killing diseases of India, and suppose nothing were done to
                increase the production of food or to restrict the growth of
                population, the inevitable result would be the replacement of
                the tragedy of death from disease by the greater tragedy of
                death by starvation.</q>”</p>
        <p>Not a very happy prospect for the returning warrior, Private Rami,
            who has been giving everything he possessed to bring democracy and
            freedom to the world. What freedom has he achieved when he lacks the
            basic means to plan his own family, to help in his small way to stem
            the horror of overpopulation and starvation in India? To improve the
            economic status of India is a step forward, but one that will prove
            only a palliative if there are always more mouths than the resources
            of a country can comfortably feed. In every country where living
            standards are high the lifting of the economic levels has gone hand
            in hand with a conscious regulation of human fertility.</p>
        <p>In many respects the Chinese solider returns to the same situation as
            the Indian does. Mechanization of the vast<place reg="China"> country</place>, further
            cultivation of its broad acres and development of its resources
            won't solve the problem of mere numbers, of too rapid breeding.
            There must be an intelligent population policy to balance
            subsistence with numbers, so that nations no longer need rely on
            famine and disaster for relief, or, as in the cases of the Axis
            nations, be provided with an excuse to burst their boundaries
            seeking <foreign id="German">Lebensraum</foreign>.</p>
        <p>I have tried with a few specific examples to indicate how important
            intelligent population policies will be in the postwar world, in
            terms of human happiness and in terms of world peace and well-being.
            The nations of which I have written all belong to the Allied cause.
            It is even more important for the peace of the world that we
            encourage sound population control among the defeated Axis nations.
            None of our postwar plans will be effective if this vital matter is
            omitted. No matter what punishments and restrictions we impose upon
            the losers, if they are allowed to breed beyond the capacity of
            their resources or to use their dense numbers as a justification for
            aggression, we will again inevitably face the problem of violence;
            we will create new misery and a basis for new global conflicts.</p>
        <p>Far from welcoming population checks, the Axis nations have competed
            and vied in a race for more and more babies. They have
            systematically decimated their enemies, drawn off the younger male
            populations into concentration camps and forced labor, when they
            have not actually slaughtered them with a view to making
                <place>Germany</place> eugenically and numerically--as well as
            in a military sense--the ruler of the world. The Nazis have
            encouraged illegitimacy in their mad desire to create more little
            Nazis, given these children the dubious honor of having Nazi
            dignitaries for godparents. We can't prepare for a decent world, its
            population in proportion to resources, if fascist-minded leadership
            is allowed to promote unrestrained breeding. So far this important
            consideration has not appeared in any of the postwar plans under
            consideration or in any of the proposed “solutions” for what to do
            with the enemy. Only the demographers who have little to do with the
            concrete peace plans have expressed concern about the postwar
            population policies of the world.</p>
        <p>I want to emphasize finally that any measure for solving the problems
            of population should not be treated in a vaccum--that is, apart from
            other problems.</p>
        <p>Application of intelligence in this direction must of course be
            accompanied by measures which will permit the free flow of world
            trade and an equitable access on the part of all nations to raw
            material and natural resources. In my opinion, minerals and raw
            materials used for armaments must be directed and rationed to each
            nation for its legitimate uses. Only in this way can aggressive
            nations, like Germany and <place>Japan</place>, be prevented from
            monopolizing natural resources in preparation for war, while other
            peaceful countries are unable to obtain the necessities for ordinary
            subsistence.</p>
        <p>We must protect tomorrow's Chinese baby and Hindu baby, English and
            Russian baby, Puerto Rican, Negro and white American babies who will
            stand side by side to heal the scars of this conflict and to bring
            promise of a better future. In addition, the war-shattered European
            mothers who will produce so many of tomorrow's children must be
            allowed a chance to return to strength and sanity before continuing
            their child-bearing. Never before in history have we realized how
            important it is to all of us that each of these children be born
            strong and with a prospect of growing into useful and decent
            adulthood.</p>
