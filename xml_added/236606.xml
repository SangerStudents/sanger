        <head>Population - Everybody's Business</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <head type="sub"> Control of the Birthrate a Necessary Consideration in Peace
            Building</head>
        <p>Population is a dull technical word that unfortunately means little to the average man.
            He knows when the birth rate rises sharply or drops sharply because he sees this fact
            either lauded or deplored in the public press. But the problems of population he is
            willing to leave to the experts, feeling that they don’t concern him at all. The idea
            that population is actually himself has never occurred to him; the idea that population
            problems are a factor in having caused the war he is fighting would doubtless baffle or
            possibly even amuse him.</p>
        <p>In his vague concern over "postwar plans," he doesn’t realize that an intelligent
            population policy for the world is one of the things that may keep his son out of a war
            like the present, only far worse, because modern ingenuity figures out each year more
            and deadlier means of killing human beings. Population control can contribute to your
            happiness, security and prosperity, on the one hand, just as lack of it must inevitably
            result in poverty, famine and--too often--war.</p>
        <p>If somehow the little man could be made to realize the importance to himself and his
            family of that vague word "population," peace might come nearer to realization in our
            time.</p>
        <p>One thing is certain, global war must be followed by global peace. The gains we are
            struggling to achieve in this country must be expanded throughout the world if they are
            to be effective for us and future generations. In the <place>United States</place> we
            have achieved a favorable balance between population and resources which has contributed
            greatly to the raising of our national standard of living. But it will avail us little
            in the long run if European and Asiatic countries and some of our own possessions
            continue to overrun their boundaries and their resources and to breed themselves into
            greater poverty, famine, and many of them ultimately into war. Therefore, it is time
            that the planning and intelligent limitation of populations become the concern of the
            world.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to think in world terms, so I would like to consider the case for world
            population control through the eyes of the one nearest us, the solider son, or husband,
            or brother, Private Jones, who will return, when his job is finished, to his wife and
            their future. Specifically, what does our world hold for him and particularly for that
            hope of our future, his child?</p>
        <p>Since we are reducing population to one family, let us see how the Joneses are solving
            their “problem.” Mrs. Jones has been working in a defense factory to augment her slender
            allotment pay. Fortunately she chose one with a liberal maternal health policy, so when
            she became pregnant she was not immediately fired but put at a lighter task and
            eventually given time off with no loss of seniority to have her baby. Being a GI wife,
            she had a GI baby--that is, the government paid for her prenatal care, delivery and
            postpartum care. Again being fortunate, she has been able to leave the baby at a nursery
            conveniently located near the factory. The government paid for pediatric care during the
            child’s first year. Mrs. Jones has no parents or other relatives to whom she could turn:
            this is the case with so many young women during these days of family dislocation.</p>
        <p>The time comes for young Jones to be mustered out of the army. He needs care and
            treatment before entering the competitive business world again. He must rest after the
            magnificent and arduous job he has helped to do. So it’s better for his wife to remain a
            little longer at the job. It is very important even that she postpone the next desired
            baby until her veteran husband is on his feet again and able to take his proper place as
            head of the family.</p>
        <p>In America Mrs. Jones will find medical assistance in child spacing available to her in
            all states but <place>Massachusetts</place> and <place>Connecticut</place>. If she lives
            in one of eight southern states, she may go to the public health maternity centers for
            this advice. There are child spacing services and more then 3000 referral doctors
            throughout the country with which she may make contact by writing to the <org
                reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned Parenthood Federation</org>
            at 501 Madison Avenue in <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>. The number of
            clinic services is still limited to 600, so that in spite of the fact that the knowledge
            is available it is estimated that 13,000,000 married people in this country still lack
            access to child spacing advice. Mrs. Jones is one of the fortunate ones who have been
            able to adjust their own population problems: she can keep things going until her
            husband has found himself and become adjusted to his job again. When he has, she’ll go
            right ahead with that family they’ve planned, for like most human beings in the world
            Mr. and Mrs. Jones love children and have the human urge to produce as many as they can
            care for. Our all time high birth rate of more than 3,000,000 babies for 1943 is
            testimony to the strength of the reproductive urge.</p>
        <p>The colored American private, returning to his wife, doesn’t face quite such a bright
            future. He may not know it in cold figures, but the death rate for his race in the
            United States is 50 per cent higher than that of whites. His wife, when she faces
            maternity, will run double the risk of the white mother in this country, and his infant
            is subjected to the even greater risk of a death rate one and a half times that of a
            white baby. In fact, 40,000 Negro babies die every year, of our 13,000,000 Negro
            population. So it is even more important that this American who has been fighting to
            uphold democracy be given the right to plan his family, space his babies and have them
            when the health of his wife permits and when he will be best able to care for them.</p>
        <p>The Puerto Rican soldier is also an American citizen. Induction into the army has meant a
            life of square meals for him, of living conditions on his native island beyond his
            wildest dreams. For very little has been done about the fact that tiny <place>Puerto
                Rico</place>, an island 100 miles long by 35 or 40 miles wide, supports about
            2,000,000 people, with from 33,000 to 40,000 new ones being added each year. Since the
            island can’t be stretched and war has kept the people from emigrating, and since
            American health and sanitation measures have lowered death rates just sufficiently to
            produce an added population boost, conditions become progressively worse in this
            American possession. Pedro, together with about 250,000 others, lives in a slum
            indescribable in filth. His children are among the 200,000 without any schooling. His
            young daughter was one of the many girls seen in the streets of <place
                reg="San Juan, PR">San Juan </place>at night offering themselves to our soldiers to
            obtain food; then Pedro was taken into the army and able to send his allotment home.</p>
        <p>Pedro and his people have cost the American taxpayers $247,000,000 in relief money during
            the past eight years and will cost them much more in the future unless some drastic
            measure is taken to adjust population at least to living space.</p>
        <p>Although birth control has been made available to Puerto Rican citizens, the work is
            hampered by religious opposition, by legal restrictions. In addition, a vast educational
            campaign is needed to make those parents who need it most aware of its efficacy and
            importance to their happiness and well-being.</p>
        <p>Farther from home and in even sharper contrast to our soldier is Private Rami of
                <place>India</place>, who volunteered and is now returning from fighting for the
            Allied cause. What does he face in his native land after the great struggle is finally
            over? He lives in <place reg="Bengal, India">Bengal</place>, where his allotment of rice
            has decreased sharply because in his particular district there are more than 2000 people
            per square mile. Rami does not know this in statistical form but in the pinched feeling
            of his stomach, in the hungry eyes of his babies, and in the sad expression of his wife,
            who knows that with his return there will be more mouths to feed on the pitifully small
            amount of food that comes to them. Rami has heard that prospects are a little better for
            himself and his family, that health measures have improved. But he doesn’t realize that
            without the knowledge of how to space his babies this will merely mean more babies kept
            alive to be fed; more human beings to starve in the next inevitable famine. He accepts
            famine as the natural order of things in a land of 403,000,000--one fifth of the world’s
            population squeezed into an area only 60 per cent of the size of the United States.
            Since 1876 periodic famines and the 1918 influenza epidemic have wiped out more than
            15,000,000 Indians. Rami accepts famine as the Chinese do.</p>
        <p>Rami is so accustomed to death that he might not be horrified to learn that during a
            recent year when only 48 American babies per thousand died, more than three times that
            number, 167 little Indian babies, were sacrificed. Rami is too busy trying to wrest a
            meager existence from the soil to worry about the shortness of his life expectancy, but
            the statistician could tell him that his offspring will have a brief life expectancy of
            27 years as compared with the 64 years which are the life outlook for a baby born in the
            United States.</p>
        <p>There isn’t much in life for him anyway but work and worry about his family, so why
            should it be prolonged?</p>
        <p>Sir <person reg="Megaw, John">John Megaw</person>, ex-Director General of the <org>Indian
                Medical Service</org>, has stated with regard to the problem in India:</p>
        <p>“<q who="MEGJO">Suppose for a moment the public health services of India were to achieve
                a complete success in stamping out malaria, cholera, smallpox, tuberculosis and all
                other great killing diseases of India, and suppose nothing were done to increase the
                production of food or to restrict the growth of population, the inevitable result
                would be the replacement of the tragedy of death from disease by the greater tragedy
                of death by starvation.</q>”</p>
        <p>Not a very happy prospect for the returning warrior, Private Rami, who has been giving
            everything he possessed to bring democracy and freedom to the world. What freedom has he
            achieved when he lacks the basic means to plan his own family, to help in his small way
            to stem the horror of overpopulation and starvation in India? To improve the economic
            status of India is a step forward, but one that will prove only a palliative if there
            are always more mouths than the resources of a country can comfortably feed. In every
            country where living standards are high the lifting of the economic levels has gone hand
            in hand with a conscious regulation of human fertility.</p>
        <p>In many respects the Chinese solider returns to the same situation as the Indian does.
            Mechanization of the vast <place reg="China">country</place>, further cultivation of its
            broad acres and development of its resources won’t solve the problem of mere numbers, of
            too rapid breeding. There must be an intelligent population policy to balance
            subsistence with numbers, so that nations no longer need rely on famine and disaster for
            relief, or, as in the cases of the Axis nations, be provided with an excuse to burst
            their boundaries seeking <foreign lang="GER">Lebensraum</foreign>.</p>
        <p>I have tried with a few specific examples to indicate how important intelligent
            population policies will be in the postwar world, in terms of human happiness and in
            terms of world peace and well-being. The nations of which I have written all belong to
            the Allied cause. It is even more important for the peace of the world that we encourage
            sound population control among the defeated Axis nations. None of our postwar plans will
            be effective if this vital matter is omitted. No matter what punishments and
            restrictions we impose upon the losers, if they are allowed to breed beyond the capacity
            of their resources or to use their dense numbers as a justification for aggression, we
            will again inevitably face the problem of violence; we will create new misery and a
            basis for new global conflicts.</p>
        <p>Far from welcoming population checks, the Axis nations have competed and vied in a race
            for more and more babies. They have systematically decimated their enemies, drawn off
            the younger male populations into concentration camps and forced labor, when they have
            not actually slaughtered them with a view to making <place>Germany</place> eugenically
            and numerically--as well as in a military sense--the ruler of the world. The <org
                reg="Nationalist Socialist German Worker's Party">Nazis</org> have encouraged
            illegitimacy in their mad desire to create more little Nazis, given these children the
            dubious honor of having Nazi dignitaries for godparents. We can’t prepare for a decent
            world, its population in proportion to resources, if fascist-minded leadership is
            allowed to promote unrestrained breeding. So far this important consideration has not
            appeared in any of the postwar plans under consideration or in any of the proposed
            “solutions” for what to do with the enemy. Only the demographers who have little to do
            with the concrete peace plans have expressed concern about the postwar population
            policies of the world.</p>
        <p>I want to emphasize finally that any measure for solving the problems of population
            should not be treated in a vaccum--that is, apart from other problems.</p>
        <p>Application of intelligence in this direction must of course be accompanied by measures
            which will permit the free flow of world trade and an equitable access on the part of
            all nations to raw material and natural resources. In my opinion, minerals and raw
            materials used for armaments must be directed and rationed to each nation for its
            legitimate uses. Only in this way can aggressive nations, like Germany and
                <place>Japan</place>, be prevented from monopolizing natural resources in
            preparation for war, while other peaceful countries are unable to obtain the necessities
            for ordinary subsistence.</p>
        <p>We must protect tomorrow’s Chinese baby and Hindu baby, English and Russian baby, Puerto
            Rican, Negro and white American babies who will stand side by side to heal the scars of
            this conflict and to bring promise of a better future. In addition, the war-shattered
            European mothers who will produce so many of tomorrow’s children must be allowed a
            chance to return to strength and sanity before continuing their child-bearing. Never
            before in history have we realized how important it is to all of us that each of these
            children be born strong and with a prospect of growing into useful and decent
            adulthood.</p>
