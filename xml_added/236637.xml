        <head>BIRTH CONTROL ADVANCES</head>
        <head type="sub">A Reply to the Pope</head>
        <byline>by Margaret Sanger</byline>
        <div type="section">
            <p> The steady advance of the birth control movement can only receive fresh impetus from
                the new interest which has been aroused by the attack of Pope <person>Pius
                    XI</person>.</p>
            <p>His encyclical letter, “<title>Of chaste marriage</title>,” made public in January,
                1931, aims to regulate the conjugal affairs of Catholic men and women, without the
                benefit of science, and according to theories written by <person>St.
                    Augustine</person>, also a bachelor, who died fifteen centuries ago. The Pope
                makes it perfectly plain that Catholics are expected to give up health, happiness,
                and life itself while making every other conceivable sacrifice rather than to have
                dominion over nature's processes of procreation. His letter denies that any claims
                of poverty, sickness, or other hindrances to proper rearing of children are valid
                reasons for the scientific limitation of offspring. As for the breeding of criminal,
                diseased, feeble-minded, and insane classes, the Pope opposes every method of
                control except that of suggesting to these unfortunate people to please not do it
                any more.</p>
            <p>One must deplore the fact that Pope Pius should have chosen this time of the world's
                distress from unemployment, poverty, and economic maladjustment to advertise
                doctrines and advise conduct which can only tend to aggravate that distress. But the
                reason for his outburst is no secret.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">The Fear of Progress</head>
            <p>The Pope is alarmed. He admits that a new and, as he thinks, “<q who="PIU">utterly
                    perverse</q>” morality is “<q who="PIU">gradually gaining ground.</q>” This “<q
                    who="PIU">has begun to spread even among the faithful.</q>” We need not wonder
                what he means. He makes specific and repeated references to birth control by
                contraceptive measures as a main object of his attack. He admits that there are
                growing multitudes who either hold or harken to ideas on marriage opposed to his,
                for he stresses the world-wide expression of such ideas through novels, plays,
                movies, radio broadcasting and, as he puts its, through “<q who="PIU">all the
                    inventions of modern science.</q>” We who favor scientific birth control may
                take new courage from the tribute to our progress paid by such high authority. And I
                hope that he charitably includes us when he concedes that “<q who="PIU">not all the
                    sponsors of these new doctrines are carried to the extremes of unbridled
                    lust.</q>”</p>
            <p>Since it is not the purpose of this reply to enter upon theological discussion-- for
                I believe people have a right to worship in their own way, providing they do not
                impose their doctrines upon me-- I shall merely mention in passing that Pope Pius
                alludes to himself as one “<q who="PIU">whom the Father has appointed over His
                    field,</q>” and holds that the <org>Catholic Church</org> is the only authorized
                guardian and interpreter of a “<soCalled>Divine law</soCalled>” applying to
                marriage. We consider it highly significant in this connection that there are
                Catholic women among the very human mortals who come to the <org>Birth Control
                    Clinical Research Bureau</org>, in <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>,
                to seek information about contraceptive measures. In fact, the records of the Bureau
                show that Catholics are as eager for help as persons of either Jewish or Protestant
                confessions, the distribution being about one-third for each of the three religious
                groups.</p>

        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Converts to Scientific Control</head>
            <p>The intense growing demand for scientific knowledge of how to control the size of
                families is a phenomenon that has so impressed non-Catholic social and religious
                leaders who were formerly opposed to the movement that they have been taking thought
                individually and in groups. As a result they have been changing their conduct to fit
                the new needs. Witness <org>the Church of <place>England</place></org>. <name
                    type="conference">The Lambeth Conference</name> of 320 Anglican Bishops, from
                every quarter of the world, held during the summer of 1930, gave sanction to the use
                of contraceptives under circumstances determined by moral and medical advisers in
                the interests both of the individual and the community. Writing about this
                Conference, the Very Reverend <person reg="Inge, William Ralph">W. R. Inge</person>,
                Dean of <org>St. Paul's Cathedral</org>, <place reg="London, England">
                    London</place>, says in an article published last year in the <title>Atlantic
                    Monthly</title>:</p>
            <p>“<q who="inge">I shall take the position of the bishops, that control of conception
                    cannot be condemned absolutely, without regard to the motives which lead men and
                    women to adopt it. There is no doubt that the movement has, in popular phrase,
                        '<soCalled>come to stay</soCalled>.’</q>”</p>
            <p>Other religious and social groups that have expressed themselves, with more or less
                reservation, as sanctioning scientific birth control are: the <org>Conference of
                    Congregational Churches of <place>Connecticut</place></org>; the <org>the

        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Thinking Backward to the Dark Ages</head>
            <p>The world moves, but the Pope sits still. He declares that he is “<q who="PIU"
                    >looking with paternal eye...as from a watch-tower.</q>” But what is he looking
                at? Mostly old books, the musty writings of ancient busy-bodies who took a neurotic
                delight in telling folks what they must not do, arguing theories characteristic of
                the Dark Ages. The habit of thinking backward may have its uses, but not as a
                substitute for thinking forward. If I were in the mood for biography, I might enjoy
                reading about St. Augustine, who had his sexual experience without benefit of clergy
                and then became a celebrated churchman fifteen hundred years ago. He may indeed have
                said some pleasant things, as, for example, that children “<q who="AUGST">should be
                    begotten lovingly</q>,” which I applaud; but, since the good Saint refrained
                from telling what he knew about contraception, his story would not give much relief
                to the poor women who come to our birth control clinics.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Weakness in the Pope's Argument</head>
            <p>Turning to specific points discussed in the Pope's encyclical, I think I can show
                that he has made certain admissions which weaken, if they do not refute, his whole
                argument against contraception. I find a vague reference to the old Catholic theory
                that sexual desire is itself a taint of original sin. This is the passage:</p>
            <p>“<q who="PIU">. . . although the very natural process of generating life has become
                    the way of death, by which original sin is passed on to posterity. . .</q>”</p>
            <p>If this does not mean that the sexual urge is sin, then the Catholic Church has made
                a concession; if it does mean that the sexual urge is sin then the meaning is so
                deeply hidden behind words that the vagueness of language is itself a concession. It
                is conceded in another part of the encyclical that the sexual impulse is in itself
                something that can at least claim respectful consideration. The passage reads:</p>
            <p>“<q who="PIU">For in matrimony . . . there are also secondary ends, such as mutual
                    aid, the cultivating of mutual love, and the quieting of concupiscence which
                    husband and wife are not forbidden to consider so long as they are subordinated
                    to the primary end and so long as the intrinsic nature of the act is
                    preserved.</q>”</p>
            <p>Since “<q who="PIU">the conjugal act is destined primarily by nature for the
                    begetting of children</q>,” we understand that when husband and wife experience
                the sexual urge, they may act in the natural way, providing the aim is to make the
                women pregnant.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Exceptions Point the Way Out</head>
            <p>Now comes the question whether the Pope permits intercourse in cases where pregnancy
                is impossible, as, for instance, after a woman has passed beyond the age of child
                bearing. He does not dare to say No. He says Yes. The passage reads:</p>
            <p>“<q who="PIU">Nor are those considered as acting against nature who in the married
                    state use their right in the proper manner although on account of natural
                    reasons either of time or of certain defects, new life cannot be brought
                    forth.</q>”</p>
            <p>Thus we see that even good Catholics are not always forbidden to perform the sexual
                act for other purposes than procreation. The demand of sexual nature may be
                satisfied, according to the passage quoted, in cases of barrenness, sterility, after
                the woman has already become pregnant, or after the “<soCalled>change of
                    life</soCalled>.”</p>
            <p>It would be interesting to know whether or not the Pope thinks that husband and wife
                under other circumstances than those above listed ought to limit their sexual life
                to a single act for each pregnancy on the theory that the act is only for
                procreation. In other words, must a couple, during the child-bearing years, limit
                themselves to one act (assuming fruitfulness) and one child every year or two?
                Evidently the Pope has enough sense of humor not to tackle this phase of his moral
                problem. Common sense, however, tells us that here again the Catholics themselves
                permit a vast disproportion between the comparatively great number of
                    “<soCalled>quietings of concupiscence</soCalled>” and the comparatively small
                number of resulting pregnancies.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">The Separation of Purposes</head>
            <p>Familiar experience proves that the wish for a child is frequently felt by men and
                women at moments when they are not aware of any sexual longing whatever. On the
                other hand, the spontaneous physical and emotional urge for intercourse is nearly
                always unaccompanied by a wish that this particular act be the begetting of a child.
                We declare, therefore, that there is nothing whatsoever unnatural in the conduct of
                married couples who deliberately respond to the sexual urge on some occasions for
                the “<soCalled>cultivating of mutual love</soCalled>” and on other occasions for the
                same purpose plus the intention of begetting children.</p>
            <p>What the Pope has admitted negatively under certain circumstances, we, the advocates
                of scientific birth control, proclaim to husbands and wives for any circumstances
                which they themselves may choose. I shall take up the question of contraception
                later on.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">How Many Children?</head>
            <p>Now comes the question of how many children there should be in a family. There is a
                Biblical story of how <name>God</name> told the creatures of the sea to “<q
                    who="BIB">increase and multiply and fill the waters</q>,” and how He told
                    <person>Adam</person> and <person>Eve</person> to “<q who="BIB">increase and
                    multiply and fill the earth</q>.” The population movement which then started got
                a terrific setback in God's Great Flood, but we are told that He gave exactly the
                same command to <person>Noah</person> and his family group-- “<q who="BIB">Increase
                    and multiply and fill the earth.”</q> The Pope quotes the Adam and Eve part of
                this story together with the endorsement of the good St. Augustine, who died a
                thousand years before America was discovered. It strikes me that St. Augustine,
                however, is not a true believer in the doctrine, for I understand that he had only
                one son (illegitimate) and that he said, “<q who="AUGST">No fruitfulness of the
                    flesh can be compared to holy virginity.</q>” The Pope declares further:</p>
            <p>“<q who="PIU">But Christian parents must also understand that they are destined not
                    only to propagate and preserve the human race on earth, indeed not only to
                    educate any kind of worshipers of the true God, but children who are to become
                    members of the Church of Christ, to raise up fellow-citizens of the saints and
                    members of God's household, that the worshippers of God and our Savior may daily
                    increase.</q>”</p>
            <p>Repeating these two points in everyday language, the Pope commands married women to
                bear numerous children, a. To fill the earth, and, b. To increase the membership in
                the Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>Assuming for the sake of argument that God does want an increasing number of
                worshippers of the Catholic faith, does he want the throng to include an increasing
                number of feeble-minded, insane, criminal, and diseased worshipers? That is
                unavoidable, if the Pope is obeyed, because he forbids every single method of birth
                control except continence, a method which the feeble-minded, insane and criminal
                people will not use.</p>
            <p>If God is interested in numbers rather than in quality of people, if He wants what
                business men call a “<soCalled>rapid turnover</soCalled>,” and if he prefers
                children to adults in the Heavenly choir of praise, then indiscriminate breeding of
                human beings is indicated. It is a well known fact that those races or groups of
                people which have the greatest number of births per mother also have the greatest
                infant mortality. And as for the character of those who survive, remember what
                    <name>Jesus</name> said in the Sermon on the Mount, “<q who="JES">Do men gather
                    grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good
                    fruit. . .</q>”</p>
            <p>The Pope's argument, if taken literally, is absurd. But perhaps he wants his
                followers to consider the spirit, rather than the letter, of what he says. I am
                reminded of a statement by Mr. <person reg="Chesterton, G. K.">G. K.
                    Chesterton</person>, who is a Catholic convert, during a recent debate in New
                York, when Mr. <person reg="Darrow, Clarence">Clarence Darrow</person> challenged
                him regarding the truth of certain Bible stories. Mr. Chesterton declared: “<q
                    who="CHEGK">Protestants hold that what the Bible <emph rend="underline"
                        >says</emph> is true; Catholics hold that what the Bible <emph
                        rend="underline">means</emph> is true.</q>”</p>
            <p>“<q who="BIB">Fill the earth</q>,” indeed! The Bible probably does not mean what it
                says. Probably we are not commanded to fill the <place reg="Sahara Desert"> Sahara
                    Desert</place> with young folks. Perhaps we may go easy on crowding our heirs
                into <place reg="Death Valley, CA">Death Valley</place> and other arid patches in
                the <place reg="United States of America">United States</place>. Perhaps, in fact,
                the earth is already full within any reasonable meaning of the term. “<q who="BIB"
                    >Fill the earth</q>,” was the order. Very well, we have filled it. It does not
                have to be pressed down, heaped up, and running over with people.</p>
            <p>Suppose that a couple want to have children, but only a few. Suppose that they wish
                to space the births so that one baby can get well started in life before the other
                one comes. Suppose that the mother's physical condition makes it dangerous, and
                possibly fatal, for her to bear another child. Suppose that poverty makes limitation
                desirable. What can they do about it?</p>

        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">The Nature of Conception</head>
            <p>A word about nature is necessary here. Conception takes place through the combination
                of an ovum with a sperm. Sperms are miscroscropic seeds introduced from the man's
                body by the millions in a single sexual act. Nature herself wastes almost all of
                these millions of sperms. But if a single sperm joins up with an ovum, one of the
                millions of microscopic seeds which come from the woman's ovaries, the result is
                conception. From this beginning grows the embryo which in time becomes a child.</p>
            <p>No new life begins unless there is conception. Keep the sperm away from the ovum and
                there will be no conception. The Pope admits that it is all right to prevent
                conception by keeping men and women apart, which means that it is not wrong for ova
                and sperms to grow and die by the millions without producing new life.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Dangers of Continence</head>
            <p>The Pope even permits married couples to prevent sperms from meeting ova, by
                refraining from intercourse. He calls this “<q who="PIU">virtuous continence</q>,”
                and he adds, “<q who="PIU">which Christian law permits in matrimony when both
                    parties consent.</q>”</p>
            <p>Just think of that! If the husband does not consent to continence, the wife has to
                keep on getting pregnant unless she disobeys the Pope by using contraceptives.
                Incidentally, American wives in certain states can be divorced by their husbands if
                they refuse conjugal intimacy. In other states the husband may refuse support of his
                wife for the same cause.</p>
            <p>Continence is one of the surest ways of breaking up marriage. It is the denial of
                love, the frustration of nature. Furthermore, in many cases, according to medical
                science, continence is positively harmful to health if practiced for any length of
                time. It can bring on serious nervous derangement. Although it may be acceptable to
                certain individuals as a method of birth control, it cannot wisely be recommended
                for general use.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">The Meaning of Contraception</head>
            <p>Contraception means keeping the sperms away from the ova during and after the sexual
                act and thus preventing conception, but without preventing the natural enjoyment of
                the conjugal relation. Various methods of contraception have been widely and
                successfully used all over the civilized world for a long time by Catholics,
                Protestants, and Jews alike-- but they are all condemned by the Pope. He says in the
                encyclical:</p>
            <p>“<q who="PIU">Any use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in such a way that the act is
                    deliberately frustrated in its natural power to generate life is an offence
                    against the law of God and of nature, and those who indulge in such are branded
                    with the guilt of a grave sin.</q></p>
            <p>In another paragraph he calls contraception a “<q who="PIU">sin against nature.</q>”
                He even tries to frighten Catholics by declaring that God sometimes kills people for
                practicing contraception. Reference is made to a Biblical character named
                    <person>Onan</person>. The Pope says, “<q who="PIU">. . . when the conception of
                    the offspring is prevented. <person>Onan</person>, the son of
                        <person>Juda</person>, did this, and the Lord killed him for it.</q>” It is
                unfortunate for the Pope that he did not cite a better example, if he had one. Read
                the story in <title>Genesis XXXVIII</title>, and you will see that God killed Onan
                because he refused to have a child by the widow of his brother, whom God had also
                killed. If Onan had tried continence instead of contraception he would have been
                slain just as promptly.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Man and Nature</head>
            <p>The contention that it is sin to interrupt nature in her processes is simple
                nonsense. The Pope frustrates nature when he gets shaved, or has his hair cut.
                Whenever we catch a fish or shoot a wolf or a lamb, whenever we pull a weed or prune
                a fruit tree, we frustrate nature. Disease germs are perfectly natural little
                fellows which must be frustrated before we can get well. But need we go on with
                illustrations? Nature frustrates her own processes by the most astounding wastage,
                as we have already seen in the case of the ova and sperms, which she produces for
                the man and the woman by the millions only to let them perish without having a
                chance to combine.</p>
            <p>When the Pope speaks about nature he seems to forget that the human mind is also part
                of nature. The thoughts we think and the emotions we feel are the work of nature.
                Whatever theory a man may hold regarding souls he must admit that our brains are as
                much a part of nature as our stomachs are. The Pope does not seem to realize that
                the enjoyment in sexual intercourse is largely psychical. It is a mental and
                spiritual as well as physical enjoyment. The stronger the love and the finer the
                characters of the married pair, the greater is this psychical enjoyment during
                intercourse. To impose continence is to prevent the finest union of love, to
                frustrate mental and spiritual nature in its urge toward the perfect moment of
                experience. Contraception in no way interferes with that enjoyment which is most
                necessary-- even though the Pope calls it a secondary end-- to the preservation of
                married happiness.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Authority vs. Reasoning</head>
            <p>But the Pope has no respect for the mental powers of the individual. He writes:</p>
            <p> “<q who="PIU">Wherefore, let the faithful also be on their guard against the
                    overrated independence of private judgment and that false autonomy of human
                    reason. For it is quite foreign to every one bearing the name of Christian to
                    trust his own mental powers with such pride as to agree only with those things
                    which he can examine from their inner nature. . . . . . a characteristic of all
                    true followers of <person>Christ</person>, lettered or unlettered, is to suffer
                    themselves to be guided and led in all things that touch upon faith or morals of
                    the holy Church of God, through its supreme pastor, the Roman Pontiff, who is
                    himself guided by Jesus Christ our Lord.</q>”</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">What Did Jesus Say?</head>
            <p>That is what the Pope says. Now let us see what Jesus says. <person>St.
                    Matthew</person> quotes Him thus: “<q who="MATST">Have ye not read that he which
                    made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause
                    shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they
                    twain shall be one flesh?</q>” <person>St. Mark</person> quotes the same
                statement. But did Jesus say that every wife had to bear children as fast as they
                would come? Did He ever advocate rearing large families as a duty toward God? Did He
                ever say anything against the limitation of offspring? Did He ever say anything that
                by any twist of argument can be interpreted to mean the He disapproved of
                contraception? If He did, please cite me the chapter and verse.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Summary of Reply to the Encyclical</head>
            <p>Before going farther let us summarize the main points already made. The Pope is
                alarmed by the rapid advance of the birth control movement. Statistics of birth
                control clinics show that Catholic women seeking information about contraceptives
                are as numerous as the women of Protestant or Jewish faiths. Leading religious and
                cultured groups all over the world are adding their support to the cause of
                scientific control. Yet the Pope refuses to abandon the ancient and moth-eaten
                arguments of the Catholic Church against the limitation of offspring. He tries to
                add force to his objections by claiming that God has appointed him for his job,
                which includes meddling with the intimate conduct of husbands and wives; and he
                claims, furthermore, that Christ is directly advising him. The Pope, however, does
                not quote any passage from the Bible to indicate that Christ ever objected to birth
                control.</p>
            <p>The breeding of children, even of defective children, is a very great human
                obligation to God, according to the Pope. Yet he seems to agree that it is no sin
                for men and women to remain unmarried and to make no effort toward having children.
                He even admits that it is no sin for married people to refrain from sexual
                intercourse and thus to limit offspring.</p>
            <p>The Pope tries to make a case that since the sexual act is the natural preliminary to
                conception it is sin to take precautions which prevent the male seed from forming a
                combination with the female seed. Yet he grants that sexual enjoyment has other
                purposes than procreation, and says that this enjoyment is permissible when nature
                herself prevents conception. The Pope seems unaware of nature's astounding waste of
                male and female seeds, a waste which goes on even when sexual powers are not
                exercised. He does not seem to realize that if he has a complaint on the score of
                wastage, that complaint should be directed against nature for her habitual and
                spontaneous methods, regardless of human deliberation.</p>
            <p>The strange <title>Old Testament</title> legend of Onan does not prove that God
                disapproved his choice of method. If Onan had chosen continence he would just as
                completely have defeated God's wish, according to the story.</p>
            <p>The Pope in permitting continence as the only method of birth control tries to set up
                a rule that repeated pregnancy is the price which must be paid for the enjoyment of
                conjugal intimacy, and that the avoidance of pregnancy may be only at the cost of
                self-denial. He ignores the fact that the mental and emotional suffering often
                involved in the continence of married persons is a frustration of nature.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">The Pope Looks Away from Life</head>
            <p>Having answered, point by point, those parts of the Pope's encyclical which refer to
                birth control, I want to say that his attitude in general is characterized by
                disapproval of human enjoyment and an apparent relishing of the theory that
                suffering is good for our souls. He speaks of himself as “<q who="PIU">looking. . .
                    . . . . from a watch tower.</q>” It is a tower set in splendor, surrounded by
                walls that shut out the world of broken homes, of sick and sorrow-laden mothers,
                poverty-stricken fathers, and pathetic, unwanted children. In that remote tower he
                sits comfortably, takes counsel from a pile of old books and from bachelor advisers
                and then writes angry words about the difficult problems of married folks. I wish he
                could come down into real life for a few weeks. If he could sit in the Birth Control
                Clinical Research Bureau, at 17 West Sixteenth Street, New York, for even one week,
                he would hear stories from Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish women, which I should
                think would be enough to make any man sensible about birth control.</p>

        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Coming Down To Real Cases</head>
            <p>Let me refer to a few typical patients in the concise language of the latest annual
                report of the Clinical Research Bureau. They are samples of nearly 19,000 cases
                handled last year in this clinic alone. It should be remembered that in the State of
                New York instruction and assistance regarding contraceptives are illegal except for
                the prevention and cure of disease.</p>
            <p>“<q who="BCCRB">Patient 30 years. Married 8 years. Has 5 living children, all high

            <p>Think of the terrible suffering in such lives. Think of the miserable existence of

            <p>The million and more letters that I have received during the last seventeen years
                from women imploring me for help make up a monstrous history of disease and
                suffering and fear of still worse to come. Read some of these letters in my book,
                    “<title>Motherhood in Bondage</title>,” and you will see how disastrous has been
                the ignorance regarding methods of birth control and how desperate is the case of
                those who have begged in vain for information.</p>

        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Contraception Can Prevent Tragedy</head>
            <p>It is a damaging commentary on our civilization that the rich, with their knowledge
                of scientific birth control, should have received so little encouragement to make
                that knowledge available to the poor, that the educated should have been prevented
                by superstitious and narrow-minded law-makers from providing information to the
                ignorant. Although the birth control movement has recently made remarkable progress
                in our country, as will be shown later, there are too many states in which doctors
                are forbidden to tell their patients about contraception; and the federal laws still
                prohibit the sending of information and contraceptive materials through the mails.
                This stand on the part of organized society is both a cruel and a short-sighted
                policy, because the race is vitiated by the breeding of diseased, defective, badly
                nourished children.</p>
            <p>The most urgent need of birth control, therefore, is for the prevention of conception
                in those cases where the production of new lives can mean only the production of new
                misery even unto death. Scientific limitation of the offspring in such cases not
                only prevents the creation of new tragedy, but it conserves the health and often the
                life of the mother, and on both these counts alleviates the situation of the father
                and permits the better care of the children already in the family.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">The Right to Be Well Born</head>
            <p>President <person reg="Hoover, Herbert">Hoover</person> has said: “<q who="HOOHE"
                    >There should be no child in <place reg="United States of America">America</place> that has not the complete birthright of a

                cannot limit her scientific birth control to the diseased, mentally defective, and
                poverty-stricken families. Even parents with sound bodies and minds, with education
                and means and comfortable homes, find that nature most not be allowed to follow her
                own blind way in breeding.</p>
            <p>Births must be spaced properly in order to safeguard the health of the mother and to
                favor the health of the child. Furthermore, they must be spaced properly if the
                children are to have, each in turn, the complete loving care of the parents; if, in
                other words, they are to be treated as individuals and not as broods. Then, too, the
                events of child birth need to be fitted into the pattern of the family's career, a
                pattern which varies with the changing circumstances of occupation, residence,
                travel, and the numerous other factors in the complex lives of people who count in
                the work of the world.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Rights of Marriage</head>
            <p>While healthy, well-nourished, well cared-for children are a blessing to the home, it
                is not alone by the possession of children that the happiness of a home can be
                created and preserved. Husbands and wives have other duties and privileges quite as
                important as those of parentage. They have a natural right to the full companionship
                of each other with the rich physical and spiritual stimulation of conjugal intimacy.
                For this additional reason, as I have already argued, they may wisely choose to
                prevent repeated conception, not through the suffering and injury of continence, but
                by scientific control which does not prevent the mutual enjoyment and benefit of
                intercourse.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">The Better Mother</head>
            <p>There is still another right to be considered. It is the right of the individual.
                Just as the child has a right to be properly reared and educated, so the wife has a
                right to the full development of her powers as a woman. No enlightened society
                thinks of a woman merely as a child-bearing animal. It thinks of her as capable of
                developing the finest accomplishments and powers of culture and character, thus
                becoming a better mother and a better wife. It not only grants her the capacity of
                self-development but it encourages, and well-nigh demands of her, development in the
                fullest degree possible.</p>
            <p>For all these reasons, therefore, for the welfare of the children, for the happiness
                of husbands and wives, and for the full realization of women's rights, birth control
                by scientific methods of contraception may properly and wisely be exercised. The
                growing acceptance of this doctrine is a feature of a new civilization which is
                gradually escaping the clutches of ignorance, superstition and tyranny.</p>

            <head type="sub">Birth Control Does Not Mean Abortion</head>
            <p>“<q who="INGWR">The real alternative to birth control is abortion</q>,” wrote Dean
                Inge, in his article already quoted. It is an alternative that I cannot too strongly
                condemn. Although abortion may be resorted to in order to save the life of the
                mother, the practice of it merely for limitation of offspring is dangerous and
                vicious. I bring up the subject here only because some ill-informed persons have the
                notion that when we speak of birth control we include abortion as a method. We
                certainly do not. Abortion destroys the already fertilized ovum or the embryo;
                contraception, as I have carefully explained, prevents the fertilizing of the ovum
                by keeping the male cells away. Thus it prevents the beginning of life.</p>

            <p>While the birth control movement in the United States has already made notable
                progress, in spite of terrific handicaps, we are still lagging far behind
                    <place>England</place>, <place>Germany</place>, <place reg="Netherlands, the"

                    <place>Denmark</place>, and other enlightened countries. On October 16, 1916, I
                opened, in <place reg="Brooklyn, NY">Brooklyn</place>, the first birth control
                clinic in this country. An account of how the closing of this clinic by the police,
                with my arrest and imprisonment, led to a trial and a decision favorable to birth
                control is given in the last chapter of my book “<title>Woman and the New
                    Race.</title>” Suffice it to say here that the decision of the <org>New York
                    State Court of Appeals</org> in 1918 made it legal for doctors to direct the use
                of contraceptives for “<q who="NYSCA">the cure or prevention of disease.</q>” In
                1923 I opened the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, to which reference has
                already been made. This was raided by the police in April, 1930, but the case was
                dismissed when testimony showed that the Bureau had been operating within the
                law.</p>

            <head type="sub">Birth Control Clinics</head>
            <p>Today there are in this country fifty-five birth control clinics. They are
                distributed over twelve difference states. Somewhat more than half of these clinics
                are open to the public, while the others are connected with hospitals and admit only
                patients of the hospitals concerned. Already the American clinics have become
                tremendously important factors in the reduction both of maternal and infant
                mortality, in checking the breeding of diseased and defective types, and in
                relieving unhappiness and misery in thousands upon thousands of homes. But
                fifty-five clinics for a nation of 120,000,000 people are tragically inadequate in
                number.</p>

            <head type="sub">Handicaps in Old Laws</head>
            <p>One of the great obstacles in the way of progress is to be found in the laws of at
                least twenty-two states and in a federal law regarding the use of the mails. Even a
                doctor mailing a letter to another doctor with information on how to prevent
                conception is called a criminal under the federal law. The sending of contraceptives
                through the mails is also forbidden. The sending of contraceptives through the mails
                is also forbidden. The sending of information or contraceptives from one state to
                another by express companies and common carriers is also illegal. Thus the medical
                profession is faced with the alternatives of bootlegging a health service or of
                withholding from patients the knowledge and materials which they need. Readers who
                wish specific information regarding the federal and state laws that apply to birth
                control will find it in a special pamphlet published by the <org>National Committee
                    on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org>, 17 West Sixteenth Street, New
                York I shall not take the space necessary to summarize those laws here.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Obscene Laws</head>
            <p>But I do want to protest that the wording of many of the statutes are an insult to
                American intelligence and character. <name type="law"
                    reg="U.S. Criminal Code, Section 211">USCC</name> of the U.S. Penal Law
                begins: “<q who="USCC">Every obscene. . . or other publication of an indecent
                    character, and every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for
                    preventing conception or producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral
                    use,</q>” etc. The bracketing of abortion with contraception is grossly
                misleading to persons who may have heard little about either abortion or
                contraception and may not know the vast difference between them. But a still more
                vicious thing is the direct implication that discussions of contraception are
                obscene. This must have taken its origin from the perverse notion of certain
                churchmen in the Dark Ages that sexual intercourse itself is obscene. No sane person
                believes such a doctrine. To declare it is to be obscene. To perpetuate it is to
                vilify all the mothers of the world.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Right Use of Power</head>
            <p>As for the argument that sweeping laws are necessary in order to keep contraceptive
                information away from those who might make wrong use of it, I take the liberty of
                quoting the answer of the Reverend Doctor <person reg="Fosdick, Harry Emerson">Harry
                    Emerson Fosdick</person>, Pastor of the <org>Riverside Church</org> (Baptist),
                in New York. Dr. Fosdick said in an article published recently in <title>The Outlook
                    and Independent</title>:</p>
            <p>“<q who="FOSHA">For one thing, the constructive social service to be rendered in the
                    right use of birth control is immense in extent and importance. This should be
                    made a matter of wide-spread public education. . . Suppression will do no good,
                    for it is suppressing nothing but knowledge, light, and candid thought. After
                    all, chastity has been guarded more by modesty and common sense than by fear. .
                    . Children of this new generation who have been trained in a code of honor
                    involving the existence and the right use of birth control will be less likely
                    even than their mid-Victorian parents to treat the matter lightly or to be
                    beguiled by fools. . . Meanwhile, the conservatively shocked and troubled souls
                    who find relief in attacking birth control and applauding assault of the police
                    upon it, may as well make up their minds that contraceptive information is here,
                    that it is being used and will increasingly be used. . . that a right employment
                    of it can be of profound personal, marital, and racial benefit.</q>”</p>

            <head type="sub">The Bill to Amend the Federal Laws</head>
            <p>An important step in the direction of more favorable legislation was the introduction
                of a bill in the <org>U.S. Senate</org>, on <gap extent="one or two words"/>,
                by Senator <person reg="Gillett, Frederick">Frederick H. Gillett</person>, of <place
                    reg="MA">Massachusetts</place>. This bill proposed amendments which would
                legalize the mailing of information on contraception if published by “<q who="GILFR"
                    >any governmental agency, medical society, medical school, or medical journal,
                    or if reprinted after such publication</q>,” or if sent by licensed physicians,
                hospitals, or clinics to patients or to each other, and the mailing of names and
                addresses of such individuals and institutions. It would also permit the sending of
                contraceptive materials and articles to bona fide dealers in medical supplies, to
                physicians, hospitals, and clinics, and from physicians to their patients.</p>
            <p>The bill was referred to the <org reg="U.S. Congress, Committee on the Judiciary"
                    >Committee on the Judiciary</org>, before which public hearings were held on
                February 13 and 14. The supporters of the measure, as was to be expected, met with
                stubborn opposition, particularly on the part of religious interests.</p>

        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Looking Ahead</head>
            <p>The Committee's failure to recommend the bill simply means that another bill will
                have to be introduced. If the Catholic Church cannot force its members to obey the
                Pope's commands regarding birth control without the help of the <org>United States
                    government</org> that is a good omen for our cause. The birth control movement
                grows in strength and wisdom despite religious objections and legal handicaps. It
                advances because it supplies a human need and it cannot stop, because that need
                never ceases.</p>
            <p>The extension of the movement depends more than ever upon an energetic cooperation of
                its adherents. There must be constant encouragement by word and deed. There must be
                generous help from those who can contribute funds both for the support of the
                clinics and for the educational work which will be necessary before the obnoxious
                laws can be amended. No philanthropic cause today offers the benefactor a finer
                opportunity for service which will at the same time relieve individual suffering,
                promote social welfare, and tend to improve the race in America.</p>
