        <head>Does Mr. Gandhi Know Women?</head>
        <head type="sub">What He Told Me At Wardha</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET SANGER</person></byline>
        <div type="section">
            <p> Mr. <person reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K.">M. K. GANDHI</person> says he knows women!</p>
            <p>When I talked with him at <place reg="Wardha, India">Wardha</place> a few days after
                my arrival in <place>India</place> he said, “<q who="GANMO">I have known tens of
                    thousands of women in India. I know their experiences and their aspirations. I
                    have discussed it (family relationships) with some of my educated sisters but I
                    have questioned their authority to speak on behalf of their unsophisticated
                    sisters because they have never mixed with them. The educated ones have never
                    felt one with them. They have regarded me as half a women because I have
                    completely identified myself with them. . . . I feel I speak with some
                    confidence because I have worked with and talked with and studied many
                    women.</q>”</p>
            <p>This is an amazing boast to come from any man to claim that he knows women!</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Mr. Gandhi’s Advice</head>
            <p>And after reading Mr. Gandhi’s autobiography and after having had two long
                conversations, 24 hours apart, with him, I must challenge his statement because I do
                not believe he has the faintest glimmering of either the “experiences and
                aspirations” or the inner workings of a woman’s mind, heart, or being.</p>
            <p>There are two major points upon which I base my challenge. First, Mr. Gandhi advises
                the women of India to “resist” or in extreme cases to “leave” their husbands in
                order to control the size of their families rather than resort to birth control
                methods. Second, he does not recognize that sex expression between men and women can
                be based on love and not lust.</p>
            <p>The use of the word “resist” implies a lack of mutual agreement between husband and
                wife. Thus our conversation was not directed toward that small group of idealists
                who have sublimated their sex energies into creative action into the activities of
                his own <org reg="Indian National Congress">National Congress</org>.</p>
            <p>Our conversation began on my part with an appeal to him to help find a solution for
                the masses who are the burden bearers of poverty, misery and large families.
                Continence in the life of unmarried men and women is not an impossibility but it was
                to the married woman that Mr. Gandhi’s advice to “resist” was directed.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">“Strangely Illogical”</head>
            <p>Mr. Gandhi is strangely illogical in his demand that women “resist” the sexual
                advances of their husbands to avoid frequent pregnancies. A woman might resist 364
                days of the year and give in on the three hundred and sixty fifth only to become
                pregnant. If this practice of resisting the husband every day in the year but one,
                continued, the woman could have a child every year during her child bearing
                period.</p>
            <p>But let us look at the state of affairs which would result in the homes of India if
                Mr. Gandhi’s advice were followed. Picture for yourself a young, loving couple in
                the fullness of maturity, with health, vigour and vitality, brought together by sex
                attraction. Perhaps they already have two, three or four children and realize fully
                theat if they were to have more it would rob the children already born of their
                birth-right of health, proper care and an adequate start in life. Or perhaps another
                child would jeopardize the mother’s life.</p>
            <p>Picture to yourself this situation. Try to imagine the irritations, disputes and
                thwarted longings that Mr. Gandhi’s advice would bring into the home. There could be
                no loving glances, no tender good night kisses, no gentle words of endearment lest
                such attention, such natural expressions of affection might excite the sexual
                emotions.</p>
            <p>Nothing but frowns, refusals, dark glances and frigid repulses could come from the
                wife or the young loving mother in order to keep from a pregnancy she did not
                desire. The husband would hardly dare look tenderly at the woman he loved, fearful
                of his own powers of self-control. Dost thou like the picture?</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">Advice Not Followed</head>
            <p>If, as he says, Mr. Gandhi has been “dinning” this advice into the ears of Indian
                women “all his life” it is quite certain such advice has not been followed. The
                census figures for 1934 are proof of that. They show that the population of India
                increased by 34 millions in 10 years. Thus it is quite obvious his advice was not
                taken seriously by the women of India.</p>
            <p>I contend that if he knew women as he claims he knows them, he would not have given
                nor would again give advice of this character which can never be carried out as a
                general scheme and never will be carried out as long as love of man for woman and
                woman for man exists in the human heart.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gandhi assumes in giving such advice that women are not amorous and do not
                express their love sexually. This again proves how little he knows women and how far
                away he is from knowing their “experiences and aspirations.”</p>
            <p>I may not be so familiar with Indian women as Mr. Gandhi claims to be for I have not
                known “tens of thousands” of them.</p>
            <p>But I do know women of the Western countries. In the past 20 years in which I have
                dedicated my life to the service of the women of the world, I have had private talks
                and intimate confessions from thousands of women of all nations, all religions and
                all classes.</p>
            <p>They have told me of their troubles and their heart-aches. I have shared their
                sorrows and their joys, as well as their hopes and longings. And I believe firmly
                that the heart of the Indian woman is not different from the heart of the American,
                Chinese, Italian or European woman where love is concerned. And Mr. Gandhi himself
                concedes that the “<q who="GANMO">women will not resist their husbands</q>.”</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Broken Homes</head>
            <p>Then consider the economic implications of this advice. A husband thwarted, driven to
                desperation by the constant repulses of his wife would ultimately refuse her support
                and the shelter of his home. Doubtless, public opinion would support him.</p>
            <p>Probably if Mr. Gandhi’s advice were followed to any great extent the men of the land
                would band together to make laws, such as we have in many states in <place
                    reg="United States">America</place>, giving legal sanction to their
                refusal to support wives who refuse to live with them in natural union.</p>
            <p>What would the women of India do if they found themselves turned from their husband’s
                doors? The majority of them have had no training to enable them to earn a living for
                themselves in the competitive world of today.</p>
            <p>From an early age they have built their entire lives about their husbands and their
                homes. They have depended upon their husbands for their support. And still more
                important, what woman would be so unnatural as to want to see the home she has built
                up through the years by thoughtful, loving care racked by discord and
                discontent?</p>
            <p>Yet a mother may realise that her own life and health and the health and training of
                the children she already has must be sacrificed if she has more children to claim
                her strength, her health, her time, or perhaps, her life.</p>
            <p>What is she to do? Resist her husband as Mr. Gandhi advocates? Bring dissension into
                her happy home? Or use the simple birth control methods which science has brought
                forward as the answer to her problem?</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">A Calamity</head>
            <p>Does anyone think a husband could or would remain devoted very long if his emotions
                and instincts were continually denied expression by the wife he loves? I predict
                that if such advice were followed it would be a calamity in Indian life! It would
                create an atmosphere of dissension, and even brutality in the home. Marriage would
                become a question of legal rape and laws would soon be enacted to deal with the
                rebellious, resistant wife, greatly to her disadvantage.</p>
            <p>The second thing that proves Mr. Gandhi does not know women is his general attitude
                toward sex union. I asked, “Mr. Gandhi, do you not see a great difference between
                sex love and sex lust?” Although he answered, “<q who="GANMO">Yes</q>,” his words of
                explanation showed he does not make such a differentiation but couples both
                together.</p>
            <p>What do the women of India say to that? Do they agree? I do not believe they do.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gandhi cannot conceive of this force being transmuted from lust into beauty. He
                cannot believe that women know this to be true and have in their own lives and
                relationships with men transmuted this force into one of the most stimulating,
                beautifying, spiritual acts of human experience.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gandhi cannot understand this. He is too inhibited by his own emotions to accept
                this fact, but were it not true, marriage would indeed have become a vulgar,
                debasing institution and would long ago have collapsed.</p>
            <p>I would not feel free to mention this point were it given in confidence, but Mr.
                Gandhi has already expressed it in his autobiography and with unusual frankness and
                candour discussed his own experiences.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Fear as Restraint</head>
            <p>Mr. Gandhi has an appalling fear that licentiousness and over-indulgence will occur
                unless there is a fear of pregnancy to restrain the man. Has he ever thought that
                the same frequency can occur during the nine months of a woman’s pregnancy? Does he
                think of that condition in the lives of married people who know that for reasons of
                sterility or barrenness, pregnancy cannot result?</p>
            <p>I said to him, “But Mr. Gandhi, there are thousands, millions, who regard your word
                as that of a saint. How can you ask them who are not so strong nor wise as you, to
                follow such advice when you yourself acknowledge that it has taken you years to
                overcome and control the force that nature implanted in your being?”</p>
            <p>Mr. Gandhi merely smiled.</p>
