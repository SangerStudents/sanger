        <p>If the people of the <del>world</del>
            <add><place reg="United States">USA</place></add> will accept Asiatic level of living in
            order to keep the promises of our <person reg="Roosevelt, Franklin D."
                >President</person> well &amp; good-- a most noble sacrifice(??) But let us accept
            it consciously &amp; know that not we alone but other Nations with our food standards
            must share our noble sentiments so that three billion of the <place>Earth</place>’s
            inhabitants may live on a survival quota.-- </p>
        <p>Perhaps this suggestion will arouse <del>the</del> our opponents’ curiosity let us see
            how willing they are to tighten their belts to see an <add>world</add> increased
            population decrease our own standards of living within the life time of those in this
            room.</p>
        <p>In other words we ask a people with reserve &amp; resources sufficient to yield a
            permanent basis for a healthy population to live joyfully &amp; prosper to sacrifice
            that condition for themselves &amp; their unborn children in exchange for a large
            recklessly concerned population of illiterate miserable, people constantly threatened by
                <add>large</add> families, malnutrition &amp; ever increasing poverty.</p>
        <p>USA &amp; <org reg="United Nations">UN</org> should have a Population &amp; Eugenic
            Policy with two experts in the President’s Cabinet and policy established that there are
            certain eugenic qualifications for reproduction &amp; definitely lay down the law--that
            these couples who cannot meet those qualifications <emph rend="underline">must not
                reproduce</emph>.</p>
        <p>Such qualifications &amp; requirements for reproducing will make the children born
            symbols of honor to our civilization.--</p>
        <p>Another suggestion I once made at a Social tea in the <unclear>drawing</unclear> room of
                <person reg="Mesta, Perle Skirvin">Mrs. Mesta</person> in <place reg="Newport, RI"
                >Newport</place>--when <person reg="Blank, Mrs.">Mrs. Blank</person> said she
            objected to BC because her lovely niece &amp; brilliant nephew each had only one child
            while all the “<q who="UNK">riff raff</q>” were having dozens--</p>
        <p>I made the gentle suggestion to Mrs. Blank that perhaps her brilliant &amp; lovely
            relatives were also endowed with natural qualities of <emph rend="underline"
                >Responsibility</emph> toward educating &amp; rearing children they were not able
            financially to rear adequately--Then I said suppose Mrs. Blank instead of your
            contributing large sums of money every year to the community chest to orphanages,
                <org>Red Cross</org> &amp; other charities &amp; Philanthropies but gave that total
            divided equally to your two relatives you might find they would be happy to launch a few
            more babes in this world if you agreed that the added offspring, maintenance was
            secured--</p>
        <p>She said “<q who="UNK">That is a New Idea</q>”-- while a few Medical Schools, a very few
            have classes &amp; lectures on contraception. No college or university has a Population
            Department as they have departments of History department a or <add>Dept.</add>
            <unclear>Mar</unclear> etc. yet Population conditions pressure &amp; rate of growth are
            the basis of today’s world miseries &amp; problems &amp; threaten to grow worse.</p>
