			<p>In that “open letter to biographers” which he dashed off upon the completion of his
					<title type="book">Study of British Genius</title>, <person
					reg="Ellis, Havelock">Havelock Ellis</person> pointed out that many biographies
				were often merely “<q who="ELLHA">slices of misplaced history</q>,” and warned all
				future biographers to study the roots of the lives they recorded. “<q who="ELLHA"
					>After the age of twenty, your task becomes easier and more obvious; after
					thirty, if so far you have fulfilled that task, what is there further left to
					tell? The rest is but the liberation of a mighty spring, the slow running down
					of energy. The man recedes to give place to his deeds, whether such deeds be the
					assault of great fortresses, or the escalade of mighty sentences.</q>”</p>
			<p><person reg="Peterson, Houston">Houston Peterson</person>, who has valiantly
				undertaken to write the life of <title type="book">Havelock Ellis</title>* who at
				sixty-nine is still keenly sensitive to the dangers of this difficult art, has
				evidently taken to heart this warning. The result is that, intentionally or not, the
				first chapters, dealing with the hereditary background, with the childhood, youth
				and early manhood of his subject are far more important to our fuller understanding
				of this life-giving spirit than, say, the final five chapters, which, in our humble
				opinion, seem to rely too completely upon quotations from the works of Ellis
				himself- quotations significant in themselves, but revealing nothing new to any of
				us who have drunk deep at the spring of wisdom which Havelock Ellis has liberated to
				irrigate the arid wastes of our Anglo-Saxon world.</p>
			<p>But before proffering even these tentative criticisms of Mr. Peterson’s significant
				biography, we must first express unqualified admiration for the thoroughness which
				he has documented himself, and for the keen incisive scholarship which has gone into
				the creation of this book. Instead of carping on its limitations, let us rejoice in
				the painstaking preparation, the indefatigable research, and the skilful
				reconstruction fo a life, fascinating and unique in every phase, which this volume
				reveals to us.</p>
			<p>The heredity, the birth, the development of the boy and his early blossoming into a
				grave maturity, are all recounted with a distinct narrative gift, and practically
				never with any slurring of the significant steps onward. The excerpts from the early
				notebooks and diaries, which Havelock Ellis began at the age of ten, are especially
				interesting. They reveal the remarkable precocity of genius. His admirations and his
				enthusiasms during his adolescence were indeed immature, but already he was able to
				articulate and express his thoughts with unclouded clearness.</p>
			<p>Mr. Peterson makes us realize that this son of <person reg="Ellis, Edward Peppen">a
					British sea-captain</person> inherited much of the valiant courage of a race of
				mariners. Resolutely he dared to voyage alone through uncharted seas of forbidden
				research. With the uncanny self-reliance of genius, he decided upon this life-voyage
				when he was a lad scarcely past sixteen. “<q who="PETHO">He would explore the
					dangerous ocean of sex and perhaps find for humanity an Earthly Paradise!</q>”
				So exclaims Mr. Peterson, in relating that early decision of young Henry Havelock
				Ellis, adding Ellis’s own testimony to the effect that he never deviated form this
				adolescent resolution: “<q who="ELLHA">... in all that I have done, that resolve has
					never been very far from my thoughts</q>.” In 1926 Ellis commented further: “<q
					who="ELLHA">I am sure that I never for a moment anticipated that my efforts in
					that direction would arouse so wide an echo in the world</q>.”</p>
			<p>The far-flung schemes of adolescence, the biographer sagely point out, are often
				little more than laughable, but here was the decision of a sixteen-year-old,
				destined to be carried out through a long lifetime. The only satisfactory
				explanation, I believe, can be discovered when we realize that, like all authentic
				geniuses, the lonely sixteen-year-old youth, strolling under the feathery
				eucalyptuses of an Australian village, had developed intellectually and spiritually
				far beyond what is ordinary considered normal.</p>
			<p>Particularly interesting is Mr. Peterson’s account of Ellis’s early perusal of
					<person reg="Drysdale, George">George Drysdale</person>’s <title type="book"
					>Elements of Social Science</title>, and the support the youth found in that
				anonymous book for his own grave convictions regarding the importance of sex, and
				his conversion, before his twentieth year, to the doctrine of contraception.</p>
			<p>Without wasting space to go further into the many fascinating details unearthed by
				this industrious biographer, let us recommend Houston Peterson’s book at once as
					<foreign lang="LAT">sine qua non</foreign> to everyone who looks upon Havelock
				Ellis as one of the outstanding heroes of western civilization. Having done this,
				and having thanked Mr. Peterson for his generous recognition fo ourselves and the
					<title type="journal">BIRTH CONTROL REVIEW</title> as a source of certain
				materials, we may turn to a consideration fo certain phases of this biography which
				please us less than the specific chapters we have noted.</p>
			<p>Our criticism is not directed specifically toward this book; it is to all biographers
				which seek to portray a living man. Evidently in the preparation fo such an
				interpretation as the present, the biographer finds himself brought into much closer
				personal contact with his subject than when, in the first flush of enthusiasm, his
				decision to undertake a biography comes upon him. As he prepares his literary
				portrait, he is like a painter who must study the anatomy of his sitter, who must
				approach so closely that he sees details and defects and finally, as so often
				happens, temporarily loses his vision fo the inner animating spirit--of the movement
				behind that “<q who="ELLHA">liberation of a mighty spring</q>.” The successful
				biographer must regain the thrill of his initial inspiration- he must not only study
				every phase of his subject, but must master his own relation to that subject.</p>
			<p>With all his competence, and masterly scholarship, I cannot escape the feeling that
				somehow or other Houston Peterson has failed to sustain the stability of his
				relationship to Havelock Ellis. Facts he gives us in abundance--details of his life,
				his friends, his predilections. But after all, we are not so much interested in the
				elderly literary man who lives in <place reg="Brixton, England">Brixton</place>, and
				does his own cooking, as we are in that living and eternal spirit who seems to dwell
				serenely above the limitations of time and space, whose radiance, like that of the
				life-giving sun, has penetrated beyond oceans and continents, and has performed
				miracles in creating hope and joy where despair and melancholy had existed before. I
				am not trying to indulge in poetic fancy. Before the advent of the radio, before the
				achievements of aviation, the message of Havelock Ellis--“broadcasted” despite the
				many obstacles put in its way- has been “picked up” in far-away corners of the
				earth, as innumerable letters from obscure people have testified. It is almost as
				though- to continue our analogy- provided with a receiving set, these sensitive
				minds had “picked up” a distant station, and from it had received a deep and
				beneficent message of human salvation. Those who have had this experience can never
				look upon Havelock Ellis as a mere mortal. Through him, as through <person
					reg="Francis of Assisi, St.">Saint Francis</person>, is irradiated the wisdom of
				divinity.</p>
			<p>Houston Peterson will undoubtedly laugh at this “pseudo-mysticism.” But those of us
				who find in Ellis a god can never be quite satisfied with a realistic portrait,
				which, from a distance, slightly diminishes his true stature.</p>
