                on Population and World Resources in Relation to Family</org>
            was introduced by Lady <person reg="Denman, Gertrude">Gertrude

                owning to Mr.s Margaret Sanger's enthusiasm and generosity that
                the present Congress had been called together. (Applause) She
                could perhaps best sum up what they all felt and thought about
                Mrs. Margaret Sanger by quoting from an American official
                document, which said that the <org>America Women's
                    Association</org> Medal was given to Mrs. Sanger "for her
                vision, integrity and valour." No one could have a better
                tribute than that.</q>.</p>
        <p>Sanger used this same address at the Pioneers Luncheon given by the

        <head>Address by Mrs. Margaret Sanger</head>
        <p>I am really quite moved tonight to have this reception, and terribly
            pleased. I thought that the one reception last night was quite
            sufficient, but I am flattered by having a special affair of this
            kind, and I thank the <org
                reg="International Congress on Population and World Resources in Relation to Family, Conference Committee"
                >Committee</org> very much for this honour. Although I was told
            that I must not do much thanking, nevertheless I must say a word of
            thanks to a few friends who helped in the beginning to get me going
            for this Congress -- Dr. <person reg="Blacker, C. P."
                >Blacker</person>, Dr. <person reg="Griffith, Edward Fyfe"
                >Griffith</person>, Mr. <person reg="Chance, Clinton F."
                >Chance</person> (who I regret is not here) and, of course,
            always the <person reg="Guy, John Henry"><person
                    reg="Guy, Gerda Sebbelov">Guys</person></person>, and Mrs.
                <person reg="Wright, Helena">Helena Wright</person>.</p>
        <p>Always in <place>England</place> there have been these various
            splendid friends. It seems to me that it has been like a great
            tapestry of human endeavour, the birth control work between England
            and the <place>United States</place>, and I think it will continue
            as it began, some 25 or 30 years ago. </p>
        <p>The Committee has asked me to give you briefly a summary of the birth
            control movement. If I were to do that, I should keep you here until
            the morning, and so when this letter came to me I had an idea for
            doing it in a different way, and I got out a pamphlet on 150 years
            of birth control, from <person reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert"
                >Malthus</person> to <place reg="Cheltenham, England"
                >Cheltenham</place>. I want to give the first copy to Lord
                <person reg="Horder, Thomas">Horder</person>, and the next to
            Lady <person reg="Denman, Gertrude Mary">Denman</person>, and copies
            to all the speakers here; and all the delegates will also have a
            special copy later. (Applause).</p>
        <p>Having said that, and having given a summary of the movement in this
            pamphlet, I can now ramble on.</p>
        <p>There are just a few things for which I take credit in this great
            humanitarian movement, and the first, which I consider much more
            important than most people do, is that I coined a term to call the
            movement by. A few of us got together, and we knew that there were
            such terms as “Malthusianism,” “Neo-Malthusianism,” and “Conscious
            generation,” but you know that the Americans just could not even
            spell them, let alone pronounce them, and I know that they would not
            do. We tried one term after another, including “Family Control,” and
            then “Birth Control” came, as it were, out of the air, and “Birth
            Control” it was.</p>
        <p>It needed a little describing, and so for years some of us went
            throughout the country, from east to west and north to south,
            defining it as “The conscious control of the birth-rate by means
            that prevent conception.” We emphasised the word “prevent” --
            prevent, not destroy; not to interfere with life, but to prevent
            when there was no life to destroy. We said “This is no more
            destruction of life than you remaining single or living in
            celibacy.”</p>
        <p>We said “control,” and we did not mean “limit.” We did not mean one
            child or two children; we said “control,” and we emphasised that you
            control traffic and appetite and temper. We thought that those were
            two excellent words to pin to this idea. I consider that that was
            probably one of the best educational factors in the whole movement.
            While the name has since been changed, and I think very well, to
            “Family Planning,” that simply means that the movement has gone on
            and got beyond where it needed to be explained, and we are getting
            into another realm. I especially like the term “Planned
            Parenthood.”</p>
        <p>Another thing which was interesting and quite delightful was
            challenging the <person reg="Comstock, Anthony">Comstock</person>
            laws. It is impossible for those of you who live in England and
            other countries to conceive what an atmosphere there was in the
            United States in 1912-14. A man named Anthony Comstock, more than
            thirty years before, conceived the idea, and influenced Congressmen
            and churchmen and others to accept it, that the only way to keep the
            people pure was to make laws to keep them pure, and so he went to
                <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> and was able to
            get a law passed which covered abortion and contraception, and which
            made it a crime, punishable with five years' imprisonment and a
            5,000 dollar fine, for anyone to send through the post any book or
            letter or article or information concerning contraception or where
            it might be obtained; and that did not exclude the medical
            profession. In different States he also had laws passed which did
            not exclude the medical profession; and so for thirty years this man
            -- fanatical and well-meaning -- and his agents opened letters. They
            had more privileges than Congressmen. They opened parcels and
            packages from abroad, and especially from France, looking for
            contraceptives and for literature that might mention sex. The very
            words “gonorrhea” and “syphilis” were taboo, and whole papers were
            prevented from going through the U.S. mails if those words were
            included in any part of them.</p>
        <p>It was a serious matter; it was not just a question of threats. He
            sent people to jail. An <person reg="unknown">editor</person> 70
            years old was sent to the penitentiary and put to hard labour,
            breaking rocks; his crime was editing a magazine -- I hope Dr.
            Blacker will take note of this -- called the <title>Eugenics
                Review</title>. In the end the public indignation was aroused by
            the arrest of a <person reg="unknown">dealer</person> who had in his
            window a beautiful picture of a little girl of about ten years of
            age, nude, with the sunlight in her hair, standing in a stream. It
            was so beautiful that crowds gathered round the window to look at
            it, and the Comstock agent arrested them and the bookseller. This
            aroused the wrath of some of the friends of freedom, and it was not
            so easy for him to arrest people after that.</p>
        <p>This was the situation when, as someone said, “Margaret Sanger came
            upon the scene with three children in her arms and a wild look in
            her eye.” I had the children, and I had the wild look too, because I
            had been working among women -- poor, depressed, forgotten women --
            whose whole lives were lives of misery, who were asking people what
            they could do so as not to have another baby, because they had more
            children than they could take care of, and perhaps their husbands
            were out of work, yet more and more children came. Some mothers who
            had had large families were asking what to do to save their
            daughters from the hardships and the life of drudgery that they had
            experienced. Everywhere I went I found people with this problem. I
            myself, with three children and with a long period of tuberculosis,
            knew that this was a very important matter, and the question was
            just what to tell them, what to say.</p>
        <p>I was perfectly willing to tell them what to do, but what was I to
            tell them? There was nothing in the public libraries, and even in
            the medical libraries in <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>
            all that I could find on the subject was a book by a German
            physician with pages and pages on how wonderful it was to have
            children. That was as much as I could get from any medical treatise
            at that period.</p>
        <p>Going to <place>France</place> and to <place>Scotland</place> gave me
            a new idea of the importance of this question. I went to <place
                reg="Glasgow, Scotland">Glasgow</place> to see what municipal
            ownership had done for women and children. They had had municipal
            ownership there for 25 years, and had beautiful parks and houses. I
            found, however, that none of the apartment houses were built for
            more than four children, and I asked what would happen if there were
            five children in the family. I was told “<q who="UNK">We have no
                facilities for anyone with more than four children, and as a
                matter of fact we do not encourage people with more than one or
                two children to live in these houses, because after they have
                four children the parents are unable to take care of the houses
                or the children, and so they have to go to other districts.</q>”
            I found families with seven or eight children down in the dockyard
            slums.</p>
        <p>That made me think that no matter what the political situation, no
            matter what the economic situation, unless something is done to help
            people to take care of themselves the best places in the world may
            be turned into slums.</p>
        <p>Then I saw <place>France</place>, where there was real family
            limitation, where back to the days of <person
                reg="Bonaparte, Napoleon">Napoleon</person> there had been some
            consideration given to children and to the responsibility of having
            children. That is important. French women thought not only of
            themselves but of their children, and far more care was given to the
            one or two children per family that I saw in France than to the
            children that I saw in Glasgow.</p>
        <p>That, then, was one of the reasons for my having a wild look. I
            realised that this thing could do far more than protect the
            individual woman who had tuberculosis or kidney trouble and who
            would not live if she had children; it involved a very large social
            outlook as well.</p>
        <p>I decided, therefore, that I had to challenge the Comstock law. As
            things stood, we could not get anywhere; we could not get
            information from any other part of the world; we could not even
            discuss the matter without having difficulties and without being
            threatened with jail sentences. I accordingly got out a little
            pamphlet called <title>Family Limitation</title>, a very simple one,
            with what formulas I had found in <place reg="Paris, France"
                >Paris</place> and elsewhere, the folklore ideas of
            contraception; but it served its purpose of bringing the Comstock
            law to heel.</p>
        <p>I had difficulty in getting it printed, because every printer whom we
            approached said “<q who="UNK">This means a jail sentence; this means
                    <org reg="Sing-Sing Correctional Facility"
                >Sing-Sing</org>.</q>” which is our famous prison up the river.
            Nevertheless, we found a courageous printer who printed the pamphlet
            at night, and it was all set. I could have been given about 45 years
            in prison. It was like <person reg="Besant, Annie">Annie
                Besant</person> and <person reg="Bradlaugh, Charles">Charles
                Bradlaugh</person> over here; they printed a pamphlet and
            challenged the law, and I think that from that time onwards your
            English law has been straightened out and you have had no difficulty
            on any question of contraception here. I thought that that was a
            good example and that I would do the same, and so I had this
            pamphlet written in plain terms for women to read, printed.</p>
        <p>I printed 125,000 or more, and had them carefully wrapped in bundles,
            and then I took the boat for England. When I was in the middle of
            the ocean I gave the word, and these pamphlets went out to the
            miners and the cotton workers and throughout the country to people
            who needed them, and to a judge and a district attorney and one of
            these Comstock officials. I said that I had come away to prepare for
            a trial, and that I felt that this was an important matter and the
            only way to call attention to these laws and get them changed. There
            was such a thing as dramatisation of the situation. </p>
        <p>There is a wonderful statement that <person
                reg="Shaw, George Bernard">Shaw</person> made which I have used
            many times. He said that <q who="SHAGE">tragedies really do not
                amount to very much; if an aeroplane crashes a dozen or more
                people are killed, and if an engine goes off the track more
                people are killed, and that may also happen if a great theatre
                or other building catches fire; but then something is done to
                prevent the same sort of thing from happening again. The real
                tragedies of the world are the little, everyday, continuous
                miseries, day in and day out, year after year and sometimes
                century after century, which we took in our stride; we got used
                to them.</q> I thought that that was very true of the women who
            were bearing children that they did not want to have to bear in
            ignorance; and so I brought out this little pamphlet.</p>
        <p>I came over to England, and I had a wonderful reception here. I found
            that there were a great many people here who rather liked
            law-breakers. My memory goes back to the very splendid help that I
            had from <person reg="Ellis, Havelock">Havelock Ellis</person>,
                <person reg="Wells, H. G.">H. G. Wells</person>, <person
                reg="Carpenter, Edward">Edward Carpenter</person>, <person
                reg="Keynes, John Maynard">J. M. Keynes</person>, and the
            wonderful <person reg="Drysdale, Charles Vickery"
            >Drysdales</person>. Dr. <person reg="Vickery, Alice">Alice
                Vickery</person> and the whole <person
                reg="Drysdale, Bessie Ingham">Drysdale</person> family had
            carried on this movement from the times of Annie Besant and
            Bradlaugh, and were real Malthusians in their teachings. They helped
            and guided me in my work.</p>
        <p>About the time, therefore, that I was prepared to appear in court
            and, I hoped, shake the foundations of the American continent, large
            numbers of people wrote to the <person reg="Clayton, Henry Delamar"
                >judge</person> telling their stories. Many wastepaper baskets
            were filled with their letters. He could not read them. He said to
            the attorney “<q who="CLAHE">Take those out. What are we doing to
                this Mrs. Sanger?</q>” In no time at all, the case was
            dropped.</p>
        <p>That was not much good; we did not get anywhere. A very distinguished
                <person reg="Content, Harold A.">attorney</person> said “<q
                who="CONHA">We don't want to prosecute Mrs. Sanger, a little
                frail woman; she will never do this again. We know Mrs.
                Sanger.</q>” I said “Oh, do you?” I would not promise not to do
            it; I said “As long as there is a woman in the world that needs this
            information, I am afraid that I shall have to give it to her.”</p>
        <p>There was also an influential letter -- and I would here pay tribute
            to <person reg="Stopes, Marie">Marie Stopes</person>, who initiated
            it -- with distinguished names from England, signed by the <person
                reg="Barnes, Ernest William">Bishop of Birmingham</person> and
            ten or twelve others, including H. G. Wells, whose name meant a
            great deal in America. That was sent to the <person
                reg="Wilson, Woodrow">president</person> of the United States,
            and the case was dropped.</p>
        <p>That, however, did not affect the Comstock law. It affected me; it
            freed me to go to the country and speak, but the law was still
            there. Comstock died, but the torch was handed onto others, and the
            law was still in operation, though not quite so viciously as
            before.</p>
        <p>While I was over here, I went to <place reg="The Netherlands"
                >Holland</place> and took a course in the technique of
            contraception, and so I was able to do something more practical than
            the pamphlet. I decided to set up in <place>New York</place> State,
            challenging the law, a clinic, very much on the lines of those in
            Holland, to which women could come and be given information suitable
            for them as individuals. That seemed to me to be the ideal way,
            especially in the United States, to have the information about
            contraception given. That clinic was closed in about ten days and
            everybody was arrested, but they went on hunger-strike and caused a
            great deal of concern to those tender men that liked tender women,
            but we won a court decision. We took it to the highest court in New
            York State, and at last we had a victory. It was laid down that if I
            had a medical practitioner it would be all right, and that any
            physician lawfully practising could give contraceptive information
            for the cure or prevention of disease. With that we were satisfied;
            it was one step forward, and the only decision that we had. It
            interpreted the New York State law, and at once we opened another
            clinic, which has been in operation ever since.</p>
        <p>We had Dr. <person reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer">Hannah Stone</person> as
            the first woman physician. (Applause). She stood beside us, ready to
            take whatever came, as our medical director until her death. About
            125,000 women have come to that clinic for instruction. We have
            another department, dealing with infertility, to help those who wish
            to have children, and under Dr. <person reg="Levine, Lena"
                >Levine</person> we have marriage guidance, and so we have
            expanded our work to cover these other factors which belong to sex
            education.</p>
        <p>Finally, we even got a court decision on the federal law. We connived
            to get a package of pessaries to come from a doctor in Japan to a
            doctor in New York, and we said “Doctor to doctor. How about it?”
            The court decided that they could be received, doctor to doctor. We
            therefore had two decisions, and felt that we were able to go ahead.
            No one did it alone; we could not do it alone. There were thousands
            and thousands of people concerned. Every time I presented a case to
            an audience I felt that it was really their story. It really reached
            the people. The hierarchy and the officials did not know what we
            were talking about, but the people knew; it was their cause. We
            became the articulate spokesmen for the women of America.</p>
        <p>To my great delight, I was invited to go to <place>Japan</place> and
            to talk there at a sort of round table meeting with some very
            distinguished people. <person reg="Einstein, Albert"
                >Einstein</person> was to speak on relativity; <person
                reg="Russell, Bertrand">Bertrand Russell</person> was to speak
            on something or other that I have forgotten; I was to speak on
            population and peace, and H.G. Wells was to speak on reconstruction.
            When the time came, I was refused a visa by the <org
                reg="Japan, Government of">Imperial Japanese Government</org>
            and was stopped in <place>California</place>. On the boat which I
            was to have taken there were 125 very important Japanese coming from
            the <org reg="Washington Naval Conference">Washington Disarmament
                Conference</org>, including admirals and high officials in the
            Japanese Government. I felt that if only I could talk to them and
            convince them, Japan would not be going to war in a short time;
            because everyone knew that Japan would have to have war if she kept
            on increasing her population as she was increasing it, with a
            population half the size of that of the United States and an area
            not as large as <place>California</place>. All the doors of the
            world were closed against the Japanese, and they had no place to go
            except <place>South America</place>. <place>Australia</place>,
                <place>Canada</place> and the United States would not have them,
            and <place>Europe</place> was not taking very many of them; it did
            not have room.</p>
        <p>There then, was this terrific problem, and to my surprise, Japan did
            not want to hear it talked about. Some bright newspaperman, however,
            gave me the idea of going to <place>China</place> on the boat, and
            that was what I did; I got a visa for China and spent a great deal
            of time talking to the Japanese. I had a meeting with them in one of
            the great saloons on the boat, and they asked questions. They tried
            to get me into Japan, but it was difficult. The <person
                reg="Scidmore, George H.">American Consul</person> -- as usually
            happens on these occasions -- was out of town and we could not reach
            him, and so Americans had to turn to the <person
                reg="Davidson, Colin J.">British Consul</person> to get them
            into Japan. He pulled wires and arranged things, and I found that I
            was able to get into Japan after all. </p>
        <p>I had a wonderful reception; the women waited all day, from eight in
            the morning until midnight, to receive me. It was very interesting
            and indeed symbolic to see the way in which these Japanese women
            tried to express in English what this idea was going to mean in
            Japan. One woman said to me “<q who="UNK">Mrs. Sanger, we have been
                hearing about suffrage, but we are not interested. We have been
                hearing about women having equality with men, but we do not
                care. But when we heard about birth control, like the lightning,
                the Japanese women were on to that</q>,” I thought that that was
            very expressive -- “like lightning,” That is what women all over the
            world want, all the women of the world, everywhere; they want
            something which will allow them to take care of their children and
            give them a decent upbringing. </p>
        <p>In Japan, the officials took me to the police station and asked me
            what I was going to say. I found that my books had been translated
            without my permission, and I asked them how this had happened, but
            of course they never paid any attention to copyright rules; they
            just thought that knowledge must be good and must be free. I did not
            mind that particularly. Then we came to talk about birth control and
            what I was to say, and they went into a huddle and came back and
            said “<q who="UNK">You may talk as much as you wish on the intimate
                question of birth control and tell them all that they must do,
                but you must not mention population; that we do no believe in,
                and that is not part of the talk that you must give our
                women.</q>” I said “I cannot talk about birth control among
            fishes; it means people. I have come to talk to women about birth
            control, and birth control means population.”</p>
        <p>I had many private meetings. I think that the only public one which
            they would allow was in the <org
                reg="Young Mens Chrisitan Association">Y.M.C.A.</org> which was
            again almost private. I never met a more alive and enthusiastic
            audience anywhere in the world. They felt and they knew what was
            happening; they knew that the militarists were trying to clutch the
            people. This was in 1921, and even then there was this feeling. One
            editorial on the subject said “<q who="UNK">The doors of the world
                have been shut in our faces. We will open them when we have a
                hundred million people. Might will make Right, and we will pay
                back that insult.</q>” That was in 1921. They were very bitter
            about the law that had been passed in the United States to bar
            Asiatics. The Japanese had found very fertile soil in California,
            and had hoped to send more and more of their surplus population
            there. </p>
        <p>When in Japan I had a cable from China, from Mr. <person
                reg="Shih, Hu">Hu-Shih</person>, who later became Ambassador to
            the United States. Bertrand Russell had been there and had upset
            their family life considerably with new ideas, and I came along with
            this one about spacing children, and they were a little confused.
            Finally, they said “<q who="UNK">We will accept this whole idea of
                birth control, if you will tell us how to have boys; that is all
                we need</q>.” I was not able to answer that one! China is, in a
            sense, not so well educated in this regard as we should like to have
            it. I have made three trips there since then. The medical profession
            has taken it up considerably, and the midwives also tried to do
            something to help, but in the midst of all this, while we were
            making headway, the war came, and the whole world has been
            disorganised since then. </p>
        <p>Clinics were set up in various places. <place>India</place> was one
            of the most encouraging. when people say the religions of the
            Asiatics are against contraception, I beg to correct that error. I
            never met any religious opposition in India, except in <place
                reg="Travancore, India">Travancore</place>, where there were
            thirty or forty Portuguese missionaries who walked out of the
            Congress of the <org>All India Women's Conference</org>. Of all the
            women of the world, I have never met finer and more intelligent
            women than I found in India, and there is no question about that.
            (Applause). I visited <person reg="Gandhi, Mahandas"
            >Gandhi</person>, who did not believe in so-called “artificial”
            birth control; he believed in separation of husband and wife after
            they had had a number of children. He believed that
                <place>India</place> was over-populated, and he knew that this
            was one great cause of misery and poverty, but he would not concede
            that contraception was not a sin. To him it was a sin, and I found
            it difficult to talk with him; I can talk anatomy and physiology,
            but when it comes to sin I am lost. In spite of that, these
            magnificent women passed a resolution to have contraceptive
            information and technique taught in all the municipalities under the
            guidance of the health services. That was a very courageous thing
            for them to do. I am sure that now, as they become more established
            and settled, you will see the women of India taking a prominent
            place throughout the world. </p>
        <p>I am talking too long (Cries of “No”), but I want to tell you of one
            other thing that happened. The Comstock laws led to the difficulty
            that in the United States we had no contraceptives at all. We began
            to talk about birth control, and people said to us “Well, what do we
            do?” There was nothing practical or scientific. As a result of the
            course which I took at the <place reg="Hague, the Netherlands"
                >Hague</place> I found out about the diaphragm, but it was
            impossible to get it back to the United States. Havelock Ellis told
            me that just before the first world war there had been in a medical
            journal the announcement of a contraceptive jelly that had come out
            in <place>Germany</place>, and it had been registered as such and
            sold. It seemed wonderful, and I could hardly wait for the war to be
            over to go to Germany and find out about it. When the war was over,
            I went to Germany to find out what it was, not knowing the name of
            it or who it was that had invented or discovered it. </p>
        <p>I went to <place reg="Berlin, Germany">Berlin</place> and <place
                reg="Dresden, Germany">Dresden</place> and to many other places
            that are now shattered and gone, and finally I found out that there
            was a chemist at <place reg="Friedrichshafen, Germany"
                >Friedrichshafen</place>, near <place>Switzerland</place>, who
            had prepared this contraceptive jelly, but he would not give us the
            formula or tell us anything that was in it; he regarded it as
            something not to be disclosed. However, after a little persuasion --
            I did not leave the place for about three days, and finally I broke
            him down -- he said he would send some to a relative of his in New
            York. It was specific for venereal disease, and so we could get it
            in. We straightened things out with the relative and found out all
            about it. </p>
        <p>From that time until now -- and this is what is so appalling -- those
            two things, the jelly and the diaphragm, have been the only things
            known. It seems absurd to me that we have been able to discover and
            make the atomic bomb and yet we have not yet got a really simple,
            good and harmless contraceptive. (Applause). </p>
        <p>I think that that is the end of this story. I have rambled on, but I
            should like to end by saying this. I think that one of the most
            important things for us is to realise the situation in the world
            to-day. We have all been practical idealists, but I do not think
            that we are optimists. The charming and delightful poet to whom we
            listened this morning, Sir <person reg="Orr, John Boyd">John Boyd
                Orr</person>, is an optimist, and I could not help thinking of
            the story of the man who went to the top of the highest building in
            New York, the Radio Centre, to look out over the beautiful scene to
            be seen from there. The building is about a hundred storeys high. In
            his enthusiasm for the view, he lent over too far and fell over the
            parapet. As in his fall he was passing the fifteenth storey, someone
            called out to him and he shouted “<q who="UNK">Everything is all
                right as far as I've gone</q>.” As far as Sir John had gone it
            was all right, but where are we going? The optimist is out of place
            to-day, as we face reality and the hard facts. To be too optimistic
            is not healthy. </p>
        <p>(Applause).</p>
        <p>I feel that you are the people to carry on, to agitate and to educate
            the world. That is what needs doing; we must stir people up and make
            them think and feel and do, so that they do something that it is
            right to do for civilisation. In the United States we are spending
            billions on so-called welfare. If a fraction of that money were put
            into building laboratories and employing technicians to discover a
            form of contraception that could be taken into the jungles and the
            slums, the farms and the factories, we could place our civilisation
            on a firm road to survival. I have often repeated, and I repeat
            again, the words of <person>Victor Hugo</person>: “<q who="HUGVI"
                >There is no force in the world so great as that of an idea
                whose hour has struck.</q>” I believe that the hour of Malthus
            has struck. (Applause).</p>
