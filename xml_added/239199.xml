        <head>To Our Friends</head>
        <p>This is a most significant hour, important to our civilization, vital to unborn
            generations. One of the leading goals of our movement, a controlled population, is in
            sight. The <org reg="International Committee on Planned Parenthood">International
                Planned Parenthood Committee</org> is bombarded with requests for films, literature,
            supplies, information-----everything to aid groups and individuals to organize
            educational campaigns to spur official action and raise funds for birth control centers.
            These voluntary groups are eager to pioneer, to enlighten their own citizens in the
            techniques of spacing pregnancies and controlling birth rates. They need help,
            encouragement, the assurance that they are not struggling in isolation. To that end we
            offer this modest monthly report. We want your cooperation, support, and news of
            activities everywhere.</p>
