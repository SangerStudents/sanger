        <head><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> on "<title type="book">Plenty of
                People</title>", the new book by Dr. Warren Thompson of the <org>Scripps Foundation
                for Population Research</org></head>
        <p>Here is a book that should be compulsory reading for every individual who sets forth to
            plan for or discuss the future of the world. Dr. <person reg="Thompson, Warren"
                >Thompson</person> effectively marshals fact upon fact to take the subject of
            population planning out of the never-never land and makes it as real and necessary as
            food and water. In showing that voluntary control of parenthood, through the spread of
            birth control knowledge, is one of the most strategic keys to open the door to a stable,
            happy and peaceful world, Dr. Thompson performs a great and urgent service. Any one who
            reads “<title type="book">Plenty of People</title>” will be a wiser man when he puts it down.</p>
        <p><add>I would say this &amp; more! I have read it &amp; it is not easy to read it becomes
                fascinating--It should be placed as compulsory reading in every high
            school!!!</add></p>
