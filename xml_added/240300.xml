        <p>It is a well-known fact that there have been many pamphlets written by me on which no
            copyright could be obtained. Under such circumstances it is to be expected that editions
            will be pirated and circulated. Recently several such editions have come to my
            attention. Also, several pamphlets are in circulation under my name, of which I am not
            the author, and which express ideas directly opposed to those I hold. There is no doubt
            that many, in reproducing my work, have the best intentions of forwarding the
            propaganda, and I would suggest for the benefit of all concerned that proofs of such
            material at least be submitted to me if my name is to be used in the future. Those
            wishing authentic copies of the books and pamphlets I have written should write to me or
            to my publisher, <person reg="Maisel, Max N.">Max N. Maisel</person>, 424 Grand Street,
