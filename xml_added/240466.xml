        <p>Greetings from Coworkers &amp; friends from <place reg="United States">America</place> to
            members of this Conference.</p>
        <p>It is indeed an encouraging sign of the strength of your ideals to have called this
            Conference &amp; to help us tie up the loose threads after the devastating &amp;
            destructive war which destroyed so much of the creative effort of thousands of our
            friends’ labors throughout the world.</p>
        <p>It is a pleasure to be able to repeat that in the U.S. we have held to our goal fairly
            well during these years where our country was deep into World War II.</p>
        <p>The years from 1916 when the B.C. movement actually got under way to 1930 was a period of
            agitation and education.</p>
        <p>Many false ideas had to be uprooted. Puritanical minds had to be straightened out &amp;
            made to realize that contraception was not abortion. Perhaps the one contribution to
                <add>clearing</add> the atmosphere was the definition of Birth Control. “The
            conscious control of the birth rate by means that prevent the conception of life.” We
            emphasized the two words <emph rend="underline">Prevent</emph> &amp; <emph
                rend="underline">Control</emph>. This definition was repeated in every article in
            every lecture over &amp; over again until at last even our opponents had to base their
            objections on another line by claiming our method of contraception was unnatural while
            the R.C.’s method was <emph rend="underline">natural</emph>.</p>
        <p>After 1930 we went <add>into</add> to the legislative side- to amend laws made &amp;
            passed by <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> over in 1878. We struggled in
            Congress until 1937 when we finally had a Judicial <name type="law"
                reg="U.S. V. 'One Package of Japanese contraceptives'">decision</name> of far
            reaching importance to the effect that physicians could send articles and reports or
            supplies.</p>
        <p>Merger in 1938,</p>
        <p>Name change 1940.</p>
        <p>Today 35 State Leagues</p>
        <p>and 200 local committees affiliated with the national organization.</p>
        <p>These local groups operate &amp; support privately operated B.C. Clinics for parents
            unable to afford the services of a private physician.</p>
        <p>At the time of the merger in 1938 there were 489 clinics in private, hospital and public
            health centers – today there are over 600 &amp; now that physicians are returning to
            their private practice more centers will be opened.</p>
        <p>These clinics do in no way indicate the public acceptance or use of birth control. Many
            millions of parents find the family physician sympathetic &amp; counsels them in
            planning their families. Nurses &amp; social workers advise and direct to medical
            centers, many bewildered patients for B.C. advice. In 1938, <title>Fortune</title>
            magazine estimated that the sales of contraception in U.S.A. totaled close to
            250,000,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Several magazines have polled “the opinions of their subscribers relating to who should
            give and get B.C. information.” In 1943, 84.9 per cent of women answering <title
                type="journal">Fortune</title>’s poll declared the <unclear>subscribers</unclear> in
            favor of making knowledge of B.C. available to all married women. <title type="journal"
                >Ladies’ Home Journal</title>’s readers gave 79% of women favored B.C. practice for
            married couples.</p>
        <p>The <org reg="Gallup">gallop</org> poll 1940 revealed 77% of those questioned favored
            B.C. information through government health centers. </p>
        <p>This is the goal of the <org reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned
                Parenthood Federation</org> in order to make B.C. available to the largest group
            whose conditions are not conducive to bearing or rearing children properly for
            citizenship. These parents should be able to get advice, instructions, &amp;
            supplies.</p>
