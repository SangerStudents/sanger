        <p>The <org reg="Catholic Cburch">church</org> has promulgated a theology based on one sex alone. It has not taken into
            account the feminine spirit or the possible or potential feelings or needs of woman.
            Neither has it considered the social or biological needs of the race. </p>
        <p>The church has neglected to instruct the youth of the country that</p>
        <list>
            <item>1. conjugal life is for adults only</item>
            <item>2. to be entered into after adolescence</item>
            <item>3. that parenthood should be a responsible intelligent function, a privilege to be
                enjoyed after full maturity. </item>
            <item>4. that marriage should be a legal and moral co-partnership enjoying equal
                fidelity as well as equal custody and guardianship of children. </item>
            <item>5. that marriage is a state enabling a wide expanse of mutual development, its
                purpose is to strengthen love, sympathy and understanding. </item>
        </list>
        <p>Biblical text “<q who="BIB">Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth</q>”.
                <title type="book">Genesis</title></p>
        <p> How does the command stand when the earth has become replenished?</p>
        <p>To whom does the command apply? Everyone-</p>
        <p>Then why not celibate priests and nuns? The <org reg="Catholic Church">R.C. church</org>
            has seemed to defy the command and take vows in “direct disobedience to this command, to
            be fruitful and multiply. </p>
        <p>Thus the advocates of Christian theology quote their Jewish text as if on one hand it was
            binding on all people for all time -- while they themselves disregard and defy its
            injunction. </p>
        <p>This first command given before the flood and the Lord repented that he had made man and
            decided to destroy all that he had made. </p>
        <p>The second time the command was given was after the flood to <person>Noah</person> and
            his 3 sons and their wives, 4 men and 4 women 8 in all. The earth was empty with the
            prospect of replenishing it from good stock. </p>
        <p>This quotation today with 2000 million people.</p>
        <p>Another text from <title type="book">Psalms 127</title>.</p>
        <p>“<q who="BIB">Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them</q>”.</p>
        <p>As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. <q who="BIB">Happy
                is the man that hath his quiver full of them</q>.</p>
        <p><q who="BIB">They shall not be ashamed</q></p>
        <p><q who="BIB">When they speak with their enemies in at the gate</q>.” This suggestion is
            not of peace but of war. Children are as arrows to be hurled at the enemy. </p>
        <p>This is the idea of militarists. Breed children to kill other children of the races
            against this in chapter 16. <title type="book">Ecclesiasticus</title>.</p>
        <p> “<q who="BIB">Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neither delight in
                ungodly sons, though they multiply, rejoice not in them except the fear of the Lord
                be with them. Trust not thou in their life, neither respect their multitude, for one
                that is just is better than a thousand, and better it is to die without children,
                than to leave them that are ungodly</q>.”</p>
        <p>The church as late as the 12th. century forbid Catholics from having physicians. It had
            always been against nature and all of nature’s forces. It regulated nature by the
            methods of holy water, scapuleas, holy medals, relics of this or that, prayers to
            certain saints to cure disease and others to prevent sickness and death. </p>
        <p>When one had lived sinless non-Catholic--went to hell</p>
        <p>Purgatory &amp; Hell</p>
        <p>“Ungodly”- without beauty, unlovely, unintelligent disease, ignorance, brutality,
            meanness, pettiness. </p>
        <p><person reg="Inge, William Ralph">Inge</person>- We know where we are at with a person
            who says "<q who="UNK">Birth Control is forbidden by God, we prefer disease,
            etc</q>."</p>
