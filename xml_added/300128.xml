        <byline>Told to <person reg="Stein, Hannah">Hannah Stein</person></byline>
        <byline>BY MARGARET SANGER</byline>
        <p> When <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> sailed for
                <place>Europe</place> to escape an indictment in <place reg="New York, NY">New
                York</place>, a voice persistently startled her and left her agitated with fear that
            all was not well with the children she had left behind. <person reg="Sanger, Stuart"
                >Stewart</person> was 13, <person reg="Sanger, Grant">Grant</person>, 8, and <person
                reg="Sanger, Peggy">Peggy</person>, 6. And it seemed to be Peggy’s voice calling
            her. But she had felt the momentum and couldn’t stop. Surely those who loved her best
            preferred that she accomplish her task.</p>
        <p> But by a strange coincidence she returned immediately anyway. She learned that <person
                reg="Comstock. Anthony">Anthony Comstock</person> personally had tricked her artist
            husband into releasing a <rs reg="Family Limitation">pamphlet</rs> which was the first
            and only bit of literature on birth control he ever had given out. She heard that
                <person reg="Sanger, William">William Sanger</person> was facing a term in jail. </p>
        <p>Europe was at war then, the <name type="ship">Lusitania</name> had just been torpedoed,
            and she sailed in darkness on an interminable voyage home. She meant to defend her
            husband (she was separated from him then and later was divorced), pick up the children
            quietly and return to <place>England</place>. But Peggy wasn’t well, and died of
            pneumonia shortly after her arrival. “<q who="SANMA">Some people criticize mothers while
                working for a cause or <supplied resp="MSPP">out</supplied> of need to support
                themselves, send their children to a boarding school,</q>” she said. </p>
        <p>“<q who="SANMA">But I say that it is a supreme sacrifice. It is the most unselfish act on
                a mother’s part. It shows a selfless consideration of the child’s good rather than
                an egotistical self-indulgence in sentimentality.</q>"</p>
        <p>“<q who="SANMA">Sometimes the maternal hunger got beyond control and I’d catch the first
                train to the school, only to find that the children were happy and content without
                me. At times, the utter loneliness of life seemed too much to bear. I’d come home to
                my apartment and find the same book where I had left it, and the glove where I had
                dropped it on the floor. But the children were happy and that mattered more than my
                loneliness."</q>” </p>
        <p>Turning toward her desk where she kept a copy of her reminiscences to which she gave the
            formidable title, “<title type="book">My Fight for Birth Control</title>,” she opened
            the book to the photograph of her boys and asked us to judge if they looked any the
            worse for their mother’s outside activities. Stewart is a graduate of the <org
                reg="Sheffield Scientific School">Sheffield Scientific school</org> at <org
                reg="Yale University">Yale</org>; Grant studied at <org reg="Princeton University"
                >Princeton</org> and now is attending <org reg="Cornell Medical College">Cornell
                Medical college</org>. </p>
        <p>A slender woman of medium height, one hardly imagines her strong enough to swerve people
            toward a cause which affects one of the most vital social problems. A child among 11
            children in her own family but raised by lovable, intelligent parents who were very
            poor, she early associated large families with poverty, unemployment, illness, debts and
            jail. It was this theory which prompted her to study nursing, and later to nurse the
            sick in the slums. </p>
        <p>We argued: </p>
        <p>“<q who="STEHA">But, if a majority of mothers who weren’t pressed by the financial urge
                to earn money outside, went out nevertheless, might it interfere with their
                happiness? They would stave off child-bearing on that account.</q>” </p>
        <p>“<q who="SANMA">If they don’t desire children,</q>” she said, “<q who="SANMA">it’s just
                as well that they don’t have them; apparently they haven’t the mother-urge.</q>" </p>
        <p> “<q who="SANMA">But among working wives you’ll find that a large majority of them are
                college-bred girls who had been sheltered and disciplined so long that the career or
                job is just an expression of freedom. But they tire of it after a year or two and
                settle down to a complete domestic life.</q>”</p>
