        <byline>BY MARGARET SANGER</byline>
        <p> When <person>Margaret Sanger</person> sailed for
                <place>Europe</place> to escape an indictment in <place
                reg="New York, NY">New York</place>, a voice persistently
            startled her and left her agitated with fear that all was not well
            with the children she had left behind. <person reg="Sanger, Stuart"
                >Stewart</person> was 13, <person reg="Sanger, Grant"
                >Grant</person>, 8, and <person reg="Sanger, Peggy"
                >Peggy</person>, 6. And it seemed to be Peggy's voice calling
            her. But she had felt the momentum and couldn't stop. Surely those
            who loved her best preferred that she accomplish her task.</p>
        <p> But by a strange coincidence she returned immediately anyway. She
            learned that <person reg="Comstock. Anthony">Anthony
                Comstock</person> personally had tricked her artist husband into
            releasing a <rs reg="Family Limitation">pamphlet</rs> which was the
            first and only bit of literature on birth control he ever had given
            out. She heard that <person reg="Sanger, William">William
                Sanger</person> was facing a term in jail. </p>
        <p>Europe was at war then, the <name type="ship">Lusitania</name> had
            just been torpedoed, and she sailed in darkness on an interminable
            voyage home. She meant to defend her husband (she was separated from
            him then and later was divorced), pick up the children quietly and
            return to <place>England</place>. But Peggy wasn't well, and died of
            pneumonia shortly after her arrival. “<q who="SANMA">Some people
                criticize mothers while working for a cause or <supplied
                    resp="MSPP">out</supplied> of need to support themselves,
                send their children to a boarding school,</q>” she said. </p>
        <p>“<q who="SANMA">But I say that it is a supreme sacrifice. It is the
                most unselfish act on a mother's part. It shows a selfless
                consideration of the child's good rather than an egotistical
                self-indulgence in sentimentality.</q>"</p>
        <p>“<q who="SANMA">Sometimes the maternal hunger got beyond control and
                I'd catch the first train to the school, only to find that the
                children were happy and content without me. At times, the utter
                loneliness of life seemed too much to bear. I'd come home to my
                apartment and find the same book where I had left it, and the
                glove where I had dropped it on the floor. But the children were
                happy and that mattered more than my loneliness."</q>” </p>
        <p>Turning toward her desk where she kept a copy of her reminiscences to
            which she gave the formidable title, “<title>My Fight for Birth
                Control</title>,” she opened the book to the photograph of her
            boys and asked us to judge if they looked any the worse for their
            mother's outside activities. Stewart is a graduate of the Sheffield
            Scientific school at <org reg="Yale University">Yale</org>; Grant
            studied at <org reg="Princeton University">Princeton</org> and now
            is attending <org reg="Cornell Medical College">Cornell Medical
                college</org>. </p>
        <p>A slender woman of medium height, one hardly imagines her strong
            enough to swerve people toward a cause which affects one of the most
            vital social problems. A child among 11 children in her own family
            but raised by lovable, intelligent parents who were very poor, she
            early associated large families with poverty, unemployment, illness,
            debts and jail. It was this theory which prompted her to study
            nursing, and later to nurse the sick in the slums. </p>
        <p>We argued: </p>
        <p>“<q who="STEHA">But, if a majority of mothers who weren't pressed by
                the financial urge to earn money outside, went out nevertheless,
                might it interfere with their happiness? They would stave off
                child-bearing on that account.</q>” </p>
        <p>“<q who="SANMA">If they don't desire children,</q>” she said, “<q
                who="SANMA">it's just as well that they don't have them;
                apparently they haven't the mother-urge.</q>" </p>
        <p> “<q who="SANMA">But among working wives you'll find that a large
                majority of them are college-bred girls who had been sheltered
                and disciplined so long that the career or job is just an
                expression of freedom. But they tire of it after a year or two
                and settle down to a complete domestic life.</q>”</p>
