        <head>WHAT BIRTH CONTROL CAN DO FOR INDIA</head>
        <byline>A Radio Talk by Margaret Sanger</byline>
        <p>I want to talk to the mothers of <place>India</place> this evening
            about birth control and what it can do for your health and happiness
            in this great land of yours.</p>
        <p> By birth control I mean <emph rend="underlined">control</emph>, not
            limitation of the family, and in order to do this it involves family
            planning. By family planning I do not mean the kind of planning that
            each one of you does every day to provide food, clothing and
            comforts in your households. I mean a kind of planning that is even
            more important for the happiness of your homes. I mean planning for
            the number of children you will have and for the spacing of their
            births in accordance with the health of the mother and the earning
            power of the father. Of course every normal man and woman wants
            children. The joys of parenthood are joys which every married couple
            want to experience. But there is a great difference between a woman
            wanting three or four children whom she can take care of and a woman
            dreading having a family of ten or twelve children whom she knows
            she can neither provide with sufficient food and clothing nor give
            adequate care.</p>
        <p> Every father enjoys having children if he can support them. But he
            has a right to the knowledge that will permit him to have only the
            number he can support. A father who can adequately provide for three
            children, keep them well clothed and well fed, becomes torn with
            worry and heart-break when four, then five, then six or seven
            children come into the home and he cannot give them even the
            necessities of life.</p>
        <p> Your great philosopher-poet, <person reg="Tagore, Rabindranath"
                >Rabindranath Tagore</person>, has wisely said, "<q who="TAGRA"
                >In a hunger-stricken country like India it is a cruel crime
                thoughtlessly to bring more children into existence than can
                properly be taken care of, causing endless suffering to them and
                imposing a degrading condition upon the whole family.</q> ”</p>
        <p> And Mr. Tagore agrees with me that birth control or family planning
            is the answer to the problem, an answer that in the classes of the
            western world where it has been known and practiced for the last
            half century, has brought health to mothers and children and relief
            from worry to fathers, and a higher way of life to the entire
            family. I have come to India to learn a few of the many things that
            you have to teach the western world, and in exchange, I offer you my
            life-time of experience, in studying the problem of too frequent
            pregnancies which so vitally affect family life and happiness.</p>
        <p> Remember, birth control means to prevent, not to destroy. It does
            not mean to interfere with life after it has begun. This is not
            necessary when proper means of birth control are used.</p>
        <p> There are many conditions, both physical and economic, when parents
            should postpone the arrival of the baby until these conditions are
            changed.</p>
        <p> The first and most important is whenever there is a transmissible
            disease which affects either the man or woman, such as insanity,
            feeble-mindedness, epilepsy or venereal diseases. It is unfair to
            children to be born of parents where these diseases can be passed on
            to the unborn child.</p>
        <p> The second is where the mother has tuberculosis or a disease of the
            heart or kidneys. Her health is directly affected when pregnancy
            takes place, and women often die of these diseases because of the
            complications which pregnancy causes. She should wait until she is
            cured of these ailments before she brings a child into the
            world.</p>
        <p> The third is that even a healthy mother should space the births of
            her children at intervals of not less than two years, preferably
            three. Only in this way can she fully regain her strength and be a
            fit mother to the children already born.</p>
        <p> And the fourth condition is the question of how many children the
            father can support.</p>
        <p> I am asked, “<q who="UNK">But if we only have three or four children
                perhaps they will die off and we will have no sons to carry on
                after us. If we have many children some are sure to be
            left.</q>” My answer is that if you have three or four healthy
            children, each one born when the mother is in good health, these
            children will be healthy because upon them you can lavish
            affectionate care, to them you can give adequate food and training.
            Would you not rather have four healthy, happy children to carry on
            your name and traditions than a number of undernourished, sickly
            children whose lives may be snuffed out by the first illness?</p>
        <p> Again I am asked, “<q who="UNK">Will not birth control injure the
                mother’s health?</q>”. My answer is that far from injuring the
            mother’s health, it has been definitely proven that women who have
            planned their families and space the birth of their children are far
            happier and healthier than those who have become old beyond their
            years and had their health and strength sapped by constant child
            bearing.</p>
        <p> Some of my opponents say, “<q who="UNK">Will not birth control tend
                to lower the moral standards of our great land by permitting
                unmarried persons easy access to such knowledge?</q>”. My answer
            is that first, birth control knowledge is intended only for married
            people and for those about to be married. It is to protect health
            and to be applied and given out only through qualified and
            responsible persons such as doctors, social workers, nurses and
            midwives. In the second place it is my firm belief that knowledge
            does not cause immorality for the cause of immorality and morality
            lies much deeper than external things. Morality and immorality, all
            things good and bad, come from a source within and not from without.
            We are not honest because a policeman stands on the street corner.
            We are not truthful because there are jails and other methods of
            punishment. We are not moral because of the fear of venereal
            diseases or of pregnancy. Morality, truth and honesty come from the
            depth of our being, from character and integrity. Moreover, we have
            definite proof that knowledge of birth control does not lead to
            impurity because those people of the western world who for 50 years
            have known and practiced birth control are the men and women with
            the highest moral standards in the community. They are our doctors,
            our ministers, our scientists, our teachers and the parents of the
            best that our civilization has produced. Far from lowering morals,
            birth control has raised them.</p>
        <p> You, like many others, may ask, “<q who="UNK">Is the practice of
                birth control against the law of nature?</q>”. Self-preservation
            is the first law of nature. You men and women of India know that
            from the beginning of time, nature has used ruthless methods of
            population control by killing off the sick and feeble, by famine,
            pestilence, floods and wars. Progress means that we are applying
            knowledge to combat these brutal methods of nature. Nature produces
            intelligence and expects us to apply scientific knowledge to our
            problems. The application of birth control knowledge is a control of
            nature and a great step in human accomplishment and achievement.</p>
        <p> Another question frequently put to me is, “<q who="UNK">Are any of
                the present methods one hundred per cent efficacious?</q>”. The
            answer is yes, although the most certain methods are as individual
            as a prescription for eyeglasses and must be carefully followed.</p>
        <p> Again I am asked if the cost of birth control appliances is not far
            beyond the means of the people of India. It is not. We have a method
            to offer which will cost less than 14 annas a year. The convenience
            of this method is that it becomes a practical household utility,
            lasting over a long period of time.</p>
        <p> I bring you this message at a critical time in the history of your
            land. You are trying to prepare yourselves in every way to guide the
            destiny of your country so that she shall have a major place in the
            world, so that peace, happiness and relief from dire poverty can be
            the lot of even the most humble of your people. If you would do
            this, your first consideration must be the primary one of what kind
            of people you are going to have in the future. You need as never
            before the finest men and women possible, the strongest spiritually,
            intellectually and physically. This means that you must give
            consideration to what kind of children you are now bringing into the
            world to take up the responsibilities of your nation in the future.
            I am absolutely convinced that birth control at the present time is
            one of the most important subjects to which India can give her
            attention, the practical application of which can and will enable
            her to raise her general standards of living and equip her people
            physically, mentally and spiritually for the great role which India
            will play in influencing the spiritual development of the nations of
            the world. </p>
