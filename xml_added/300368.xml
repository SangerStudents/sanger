        <head>THE BIRTH CONTROL MOVEMENT IN 1923</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, 104 5th Avenue., <place
                reg="New York, NY">N.Y. City</place></byline>
        <p>In the case of every great movement for the betterment of the human race there are four
            steps to the goal. These are: Agitation, Education, Organization, Legislation. The Birth
            Control movement began in this country only a few years ago with agitation. The
            attention of the people had to be arrested and so the law was challenged, through the
            publication of my little paper “<title type="journal">The Woman Rebel</title>,” and
            through the opening of a Birth Control Clinic in <place reg="Brooklyn, NY"
                >Brownsville, Brooklyn</place>. Since those days it has passed through much of the
            second and third stages. Tremendous efforts have been made to educate the people to the
            idea of Birth Control. Education has been carried on by means of Birth Control
            Conferences, held in various cities of the <place>United States</place>, and also in
                <place reg="London, England">London</place>, where the <org
                reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 5th">Fifth
                International Conference</org> in July, 1922, was attended by a large American
            delegation. Organization has been going on hand in hand with the work of Education. The
                <org>American Birth Control League</org> was formed in October, 1921, and since then
            branches have come into being in almost all the cities where conferences and large Birth
            Control meetings have been held. We now face the work of securing legislation. Bills
            were introduced in the early part of 1923 in the legislatures of <place>New York</place>
            and <place>Connecticut</place>, and important and impressive hearings were held by the
            committees in charge of these bills. No success attended these bills, but the first step
            has been taken and this step will be followed up by vigorous work in succeeding
            sessions.</p>
        <p>But the work of the advocates of Birth Control has been by no means easy. With every step
            forward there are renewed efforts on the part of our arch-enemies to hinder the progress
            of enlightenment. The seat of most of the opposition is to be found in the <org>Roman
                Catholic Church</org>. This enemy is ceaselessly active and openly determined to
            exterminate the Birth Control movement in America. In 1921 it illegally broke up a
            meeting planned to be held in the New York <org>Town Hall</org>--a meeting that was
            peaceably held afterwards in the <org>Park Theater</org>. It opposed the holding of
            meetings in <place reg="Cincinnati, OH">Cincinnati</place>, in <place reg="Albany, NY"
                >Albany</place>, in <place reg="Milwaukee, WI">Milwaukee</place>, in <place
                reg="Hagerstown, MD">Hagerstown</place>, Md., and in numerous other cities. In some
            places, as in Albany, the municipal authorities lent themselves to the design of the
                <org reg="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</org>; in others, as in Cincinnati,
            the mayor and managers of the hotel or hall where the meeting was to be held, stood
            firm. They upheld the law and the Constitution. They refused to be intimidated by a
            blustering mob directed by the wily leaders in Church politics.</p>
        <p>In the press the opposition also is vigorous and unceasing. Through the reports of
            sermons and speeches, through interviews and letters to the Editor, the opponents of
            Birth Control are continually endeavoring to reach the public ear and to poison the mind
            of the people against Birth Control. But opposition has had no effect in stopping the
            progress of the movement, and the idea of Birth Control is gradually penetrating and
            permeating the consciousness of the nation.</p>
        <p>What the Birth Control movement stands for cannot be better summarized and explained than
            by quoting the manifesto of the American Birth Control League, as adopted at the time of
            its formation in October, 1921. The League then subscribed to the following
            Principles:</p>
        <p>The complex principles now confronting America as the result of the practice of reckless
            procreation are fast threatening to grow beyond human control.</p>
        <p>Everywhere we see poverty and large families going hand in hand. Those least fit to carry
            on the race are increasing most rapidly. People who cannot support their own offspring
            are encouraged by Church and State to produce large families. Many of the children thus
            begotten are diseased or feeble-minded; many become criminals. The burden of supporting
            these unwanted types has to be borne by the healthy elements of the nation. Funds that
            should be used to raise the standard of our civilization are diverted to the maintenance
            of those who should never have been born.</p>
        <p>In addition to this great evil we witness too appalling waste of women’s health and
            women’s lives by too frequent pregnancies. These unwanted pregnancies often provoke the
            crime of abortion, or alternatively multiply the number of child workers and lower the
            standard of living.</p>
        <p>To create a race of well-born children it is essential that the function of motherhood
            should be elevated to a position of dignity, and this is impossible as long as
            conception remains a matter of chance.</p>
        <p>We hold that children should be</p>
        <p>1. Conceived in love;</p>
        <p>2. Born of the mother’s conscious desire;</p>
        <p>3. And only begotten under conditions which render possible the heritage of health.
            Therefore we hold that every woman must possess the power and freedom to prevent
            conception except when these conditions can be satisfied.</p>
        <p>Every mother must realize her basic position in human society. She must be conscious of
            her responsibility to the race in bringing children into the world.</p>
        <p>Instead of being a blind and haphazard consequence of uncontrolled instinct, motherhood
            must be made the responsible and self-directed means of human expression and
            regeneration.</p>
        <p>These purposes, which are of fundamental importance to the whole of our nation and to the
            future of mankind, can only be attained if women first receive practical scientific
            education in the means of Birth Control. That, therefore, is the first object to which
            the efforts of this League will be directed.</p>
