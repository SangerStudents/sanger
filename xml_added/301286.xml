        <head>Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</head>
        <byline><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p>The essential object of the <org
                reg="National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control">Committee on
                Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org> in supporting this bill is to amend the
            existing Federal laws which prevent the dissemination through the mails of information
            relating to the subject of contraception. We want to make it possible for motherhood to
            be conscious and controlled. We want to make it possible for mothers to have safe,
            scientific information to prevent conception so that they may regulate the size of their
            families, so that they may space out the number of children in the family in
            consideration of the mother’s health, of the father’s earning capacity, and of the
            welfare of each child.</p>
        <p>This is the first time that this particular kind of a bill has been introduced in the
                <org reg="United States Senate">Senate</org>. The reason it has been referred to as
                <name type="law" reg="Senate Bill 4582">the doctor’s bill</name> is to distinguish
            it from other pieces of legislation on the same general subject, especially one bill
            that was introduced in <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> in 1925, and
            known as the “<name type="law" reg="Cummins-Vaile Bill">open bill</name>.” That bill
            aimed to take the whole subject of the prevention of conception out of the law, while
            this bill only asks that exceptions shall be made in these laws for physicians and for
            the regular practice of the medical profession.</p>
        <p>We not only want motherhood to be a conscious and controlled function but we want
            parenthood to be something other than the consequences of a reckless, careless
            shiftlessness. We want parenthood to be regarded as a fine instrument, a noble trust, a
            splendid assignment, and it can be so considered when it becomes a conscious
            responsibility.</p>
        <p>In the laws, which this bill, Senate 4582, will amend, contraceptive information has been
            classed with obscenity, pornography, and abortion. Information concerning contraception
            does not belong there.</p>
        <p><name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Section 211</name> of the
            criminal code was passed by Congress in 1873 and at that time very little was known of
            the technique of contraception. Gradually knowledge of its importance has grown. The
            need for better information, for more scientific data on this important subject has been
            recognized. And there has gradually arisen in this country a movement in favor of birth
            control. We find today that parents consider birth control information not only a health
            measure, not alone an economic expedient, but a principle of social welfare by which the
            future advancement of the individual and the country itself is safeguarded.</p>
        <p>These laws which we are trying to amend have made no exception in their prohibitions for
            literature of a scientific character. Nor have they made an exception for the physician
            in his regular practice, or for hospitals or clinics, or for patients of these hospitals
            or clinics or physicians, or for the general and proper distribution of medical
            supplies.</p>
        <p>These laws interfere with the importation of articles, and of the results of research
            which is undertaken in other countries. Such data and such results of laboratory
            research would be of great assistance to the medical profession of this country in the
            proper functioning of their profession.</p>
        <p>These Federal laws interfere with the proper dissemination of information to prevent
            conception in 47 States of this Union although there are already laws in those States
            enabling physicians to give advice to patients in their regular practice and there are
            in this country today over 50 legally operating birth-control clinics distributed over
            12 States. These birth-control clinics are medically established and medically directed,
            and have been organized solely for the purpose of giving contraceptive information by
            the medical profession.</p>
        <p>The bill that we are advocating asks that the Federal laws which it would amend shall not
            apply to any licensed physician or hospital or clinic when the desired information has
            been published in the <place reg="United States">United States</place> or without the
            United States by any governmental agency, medical society, medical school, or medical
            journal, nor shall it apply to reprints after such publication. This bill also asks that
            the name and address of any physician, hospital, or clinic where such birth-control
            advice is legally given may be sent through the mails.</p>
        <p>There is nothing in this bill which makes it mandatory or compels anyone to use this
            knowledge of contraception. There is nothing in this bill which makes any physician read
            such literature or which makes anyone apply for such literature, but we do ask for the
            thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of mothers who in many cases are inarticulate
            to ask this for themselves; we ask that these mothers have the right to go to their
            physician, to apply to their hospitals or clinics, and get proper scientific information
            suitable for their individual requirements.</p>
        <p>This bill leaves the law exactly as it was, except that we remove the subject of the
            prevention of conception from the clause relating to indecency, obscenity, and
            pornography, and place it in the hands of the medical profession, where it rightfully
            belongs. We fully concur in the prevention of the distribution of pornographic or
            obscene literature. We believe, however, that it is unfair to classify medical and
            scientific information or literature in this class and that is places a great hardship
            upon the general practice of the medical profession and upon our welfare agencies. The
            effect of keeping these laws on our statute books is to increase the surreptitious
            circulation of unscientific or harmful information which tends to increase crime and to
            multiply abortions.</p>
        <p>It is also roughly estimated that, since that law was passed, over 15,000,000 children
            have passed out of life during their first year of infancy, many of them were children
            born in conditions of poverty and their mothers’ ill health. A great majority of them
            may have been living today had their mothers had a chance to recuperate from the ordeal
            of previous pregnancy instead of using up the capital of the child before it was
            born.</p>
        <p>The inference has been, and it has been constantly stated, that the bill that we are
            proposing would open the United States mails and common carriers to pornographic and
            obscene literature. I deny that allegation. I think that such statements wilfully
            misrepresent what this bill specifically intends to do. It is untrue to say that the
            bill would practically remove all existing restriction. We only ask that the medical
            profession in this country should have the right to receive contraceptive articles and
            literature, and that medical journals should have the right to issue such articles,
            which are almost always of a scientific nature. I should think that the medical
            profession would resent the statements that the articles which we are asking to have
            legally sent through the United States mails are articles that might be designated as
            pornographic and obscene. I should think that was and should be considered an insult to
            the profession.</p>
        <p>I want to call attention to two of the resolutions that have been passed by branches or
            departments of the <org>American Medical Association</org>. The American Medical
            Association itself has not taken a stand on this bill, but I wish to point out that two
            of its principal departments or sections have put themselves on record in favor of the
            principle of this kind of legislation. The first resolution was passed by the section on
            obstetrics, gynecology, and abdominal surgery at <place reg="Atlantic City, NJ">Atlantic
                City</place>, May 29, 1925:</p>
        <p>“<q who="AMAOG"><emph rend="ital">Resolved</emph>, That we hereby recommend the
                authorization of existing laws wherever necessary so that physicians may legally
                give contraceptive information to their patients in the regular course of
                practice</q>.”</p>
        <p>Further, the <org>American Gynecological Society</org> at the same time indorsed the
            following amendment to the existing Federal laws: “<q who="AGS">Standard medical works,
                standard medical and scientific journals, and reprints therefrom, which contain
                information with reference to the prevention of conception are not nonmailable under
                this section.</q>”</p>
        <p>Now, these are the two departments or sections of the American Medical Association most
            intimately concerned with the question of contraception, with child bearing, and with
            mothers’ and women’s health.</p>
        <p>When the <org>American Federation of Labor</org> went on record, as far as the letter
            read at the hearings in Congress was concerned, it referred to a bill of 1925, a bill
            that was not sponsored by the committee that supports Senate bill 4582 now. This is the
            first time that this bill has ever been introduced in the Senate, and the opposition of
            the Federation of Labor was directed to another kind of bill entirely. This bill asks
            only that the medical profession, medical books, journals and reprints therefrom, and
            articles designed for the prevention of conception, used by the medical profession in
            hospitals, clinics, and so forth, shall have the right to use the United States mails
            and common carriers.</p>
        <p>A circular sent out by the <org>National Catholic Welfare Conference</org> stated that
            this bill was drafted and introduced at the request of the <org>Voluntary Parenthood
                League</org>. That statement is untrue. This bill is sponsored by the Committee on
            Federal Legislation for Birth Control, and it has not been endorsed by the Voluntary
            Parenthood League at all.</p>
        <p>I have never sanctioned nor given permission for the use of my name nor indorsed any
            article on contraception. Nor have I allowed the use of my name for any commercial
            purposes whatsoever, and I protest against the statement and the insinuation that
            certain devices and medical supplies have my name or my sanction. Something was said
            here this morning about the <org reg="Soviet Union Government">Soviet Government of
                    <place reg="Soviet Union">Russia</place></org> approving of birth control. The
            whole birth-control movement was begun in this country in 1914 before there was a Soviet
            Government, and indeed I feel highly complimented if we have been able to bring sane,
            safe, and constructive ideas about the control of population to the Soviet
            Government.</p>
        <p>Not only governments like Russia, but the <org reg="United Kingdom Goverment">British
                Government</org> has also gone on record through certain of its departments as
            approving of the practice of birth control. Just within the last year the <org>Lambeth
                Conference</org> in <place>England</place> sanctioned the right of individuals to
            practice birth control according to their conscience.</p>
        <p>The <org>British Medical Association</org> has also gone on record in favor and the <org
                reg="United Kingdom Ministry of Health">Ministry of Health</org> in England has
            approved the practice of allowing the patients who come to the maternal and infant
            welfare centers to have contraceptive advice by Government authority.</p>
        <p>The controversy really concerns the question of differing methods of birth control. The
            method of self-control recommended by some is open to them. They may use such methods.
            We are not imposing any method upon any individuals. There are said to be 120,000,000
            people in this country, and I suppose that a large part of that number, perhaps
            15,000,000, we will say to be generous, or even 20,000,000, are Catholics, but there are
            105,000,000 left who are non-Catholics. They are not imposing any legislation upon the
            Catholics. We in no way try to inflict our ideas upon them. They have a perfect right to
            use the method of self-control if they wish, but we do believe that we have just as much
            right under the Constitution to enjoy health, peace, and the right to the pursuit of
            happiness as we see it.</p>
        <p>The group at the hearings who represented perhaps certain moral organizations of the
            country, seem to me to be like the boy who is whistling to keep up courage. No doubt
            there has been a falling away from grace, we might say, in the past several years, and
            they who represent such moral standards must see that they have failed to a considerable
            extent when we consider that they have had so much power. They have had the laws with
            them, the wealth, the press, and yet they have come today to say they are afraid of the
            morals of their people if they have knowledge, if they do not continue to be kept in
            fear and ignorance. Then I say their morality is not very deep.</p>
        <p>We have birth-control clinics that are legally operating throughout the United States,
            and in almost every one of the birth-control clinics we have the same records. Women
            come to us, regardless of religion, desperate women, women trying to live decently,
            trying to avoid the conditions that unwanted pregnancy and too frequent pregnancy bring.
            These women come in equal proportions. It runs about 33 per cent Protestant, 32 per cent
            Catholics, and 31 per cent Jewish women. They all come with the same cry, “<q who="UNK"
                >Give us a chance to space our children. It is not that we do not love children,
                because we do love them; but because we want to give them a better chance than we
                have had, and we know that another child born into this family only deprives the
                children that are already here of a decent living with the ideals that we have for
                them.</q>”</p>
        <p>Further, when you get 570 Catholic women in one clinic, with 497 of them confessing
            abortions, I say that it is time for us all to consider this problem intelligently. It
            is time for us all to consider a fundamental need, the fundamental question that is
            involved here. Catholic women are no different from any other women. It is all the same.
            The great majority of women who come to birth-control clinics are seeking some means of
            controlling the size of their family because heretofore they have had to resort to these
            harmful methods. This is what we are trying to eliminate. We are trying to save mothers
            from this great hardship, from this unnatural ordeal. In the past many women who desired
            to control the size of their families have had to resort to an interruption of
            pregnancy, a method of which we disapprove, and which this law is going to do away with
            eventually, I am quite certain.</p>
        <p>We want children to be conceived in love, born of parents’ conscious desire, and born
            into the world with healthy and sound bodies and sound minds. </p>
