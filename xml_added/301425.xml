        <p>Now that Attorney General <person reg="Cummings, Homer S.">Homer S.
                Cummings</person> has announced that the Government will rest
            its case and not carry it to the <org
                reg="United States Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</org>, the
            decision of the <org reg="United States Circuit Court of Appeals"
                >U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</org> becomes, in effect, the law
            of the land. We are deeply grateful to Mr. <person
                reg="Ernst, Morris L.">Morris L. Ernst</person> for his gallant and
            successful fight, to Judge <person reg="Moscowitz, Grover M.">Grover M.
                Moscowitz</person> of the lower Court for his wise stand and to
            Judges <person reg="Hand, Learned S.">Learned S. Hand</person>, <person
                reg="Swan, Thomas W.">Thomas W. Swan</person> and <person
                reg="Hand, Augustus N.">Augustus N. Hand</person> of the Circuit
            Court for unanimously upholding his far-sighted decision. There is
            no further question as to the rights of the medical profession in
            regard to contraception. The birth control movement is free.</p>
        <p>What lies ahead? I call upon every one of you, who have so loyally
            supported the National Committee’s work, to push steadily forward
            with double energy. For a constructive and inspiring program is now
            possible.</p>
        <p>Make known to hospitals, relief agencies, philanthropic and public
            health officials, that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals
            frees their hands; that the federal statutes are no longer a
            stumbling block. Call on public health officials and ask that birth
            control instruction be included in their services. Establish
            clinics. There are today approximately 320 birth control centers in
                <place reg="United States of America">America</place>. I look
            forward to seeing not twice that number, but ten times that number
            at the close of 1937. Let this be our immediate objective.</p>
        <p>Beyond this, other, more far-reaching things wait to be done. Some
            means must be provided for testing contraceptive products and
            standardizing those offered for sale. Research looking toward
            simpler and cheaper methods must go forward, and experimental
            methods must be carefully and scientifically studied. Birth control
            must be understood by the public at large; it must be removed from
            the realm of propaganda and argument, and accepted as a way of life.
            Let your neighbors and your friends, your doctors, hospital boards,
            newspaper editors, social workers, lawyers, everyone with whom you
            come in contact -- understand clearly what birth control can do for
            the individual family, for the nation and for the world.</p>
        <p>While educational work in the birth control movement has been going
            on for twenty years, public opinion crystallized in the drive to
            amend the Federal laws. During the past seven years, since the
            formation of the <org reg="National Committe on Federal Legislation for Birth Control">National Committee</org> in 1929, a thousand organizations,
            representing an aggregate membership of many millions, have given
            their support and approzimately tow hundred thousand individuals
            have personally enrolled as endorsers. This is truly a magnificent
            record and an achievement of which we can all be justly proud.</p>
        <p>But this interest, which has been so splendidly focused on birth
            control legislation, is only the prelude. The National Committee on
            Federal Legislation for Birth Control has done what it set out to
            do; it has fought a good fight and won. Wider activities are before
            us. The younger men and women, whose energies have only just been
            aroused, and who are “all set to go,” must be organized for action,
            younger leaders must pass from the task of clearing away obstacles
            to the concrete program of founding clinics and establishing birth
            control as a public health service.</p>
        <p>In <place>India</place> I heard the proverb: “<q who="UNK">Knowledge is to know what to do,
            skill is knowing how to do it, virtue is doing it.</q>” Our future
            activities will, with your help, bring to the birth control
            movement, not only knowledge and skill, but virtue as well.</p>
        <p>The next issue of the NEWS will contain more definite details about
            these activities.</p>
