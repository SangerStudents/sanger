        <p>Now that Attorney General <person reg="Cummings, Homer S.">Homer S. Cummings</person> has
            announced that the Government will rest its case and not carry it to the <org
                reg="United States Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</org>, the decision of the <org
                reg="United States Circuit Court of Appeals">U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</org>
            becomes, in effect, the law of the land. We are deeply grateful to Mr. <person
                reg="Ernst, Morris L.">Morris L. Ernst</person> for his gallant and successful
            fight, to Judge <person reg="Moscowitz, Grover M.">Grover M. Moscowitz</person> of the
            lower Court for his wise stand and to Judges <person reg="Hand, Learned S.">Learned S.
                Hand</person>, <person reg="Swan, Thomas W.">Thomas W. Swan</person> and <person
                reg="Hand, Augustus N.">Augustus N. Hand</person> of the Circuit Court for
            unanimously upholding his far-sighted decision. There is no further question as to the
            rights of the medical profession in regard to contraception. The birth control movement
            is free.</p>
        <p>What lies ahead? I call upon every one of you, who have so loyally supported the <org
                reg="National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control">National
                Committee</org>’s work, to push steadily forward with double energy. For a
            constructive and inspiring program is now possible.</p>
        <p>Make known to hospitals, relief agencies, philanthropic and public health officials, that
            the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals frees their hands; that the federal
            statutes are no longer a stumbling block. Call on public health officials and ask that
            birth control instruction be included in their services. Establish clinics. There are
            today approximately 320 birth control centers in <place reg="United States"
                >America</place>. I look forward to seeing not twice that number, but ten times that
            number at the close of 1937. Let this be our immediate objective.</p>
        <p>Beyond this, other, more far-reaching things wait to be done. Some means must be provided
            for testing contraceptive products and standardizing those offered for sale. Research
            looking toward simpler and cheaper methods must go forward, and experimental methods
            must be carefully and scientifically studied. Birth control must be understood by the
            public at large; it must be removed from the realm of propaganda and argument, and
            accepted as a way of life. Let your neighbors and your friends, your doctors, hospital
            boards, newspaper editors, social workers, lawyers, everyone with whom you come in
            contact -- understand clearly what birth control can do for the individual family, for
            the nation and for the world.</p>
        <p>While educational work in the birth control movement has been going on for twenty years,
            public opinion crystallized in the drive to amend the Federal laws. During the past
            seven years, since the formation of the <org
                reg="National Committe on Federal Legislation for Birth Control">National
                Committee</org> in 1929, a thousand organizations, representing an aggregate
            membership of many millions, have given their support and approzimately tow hundred
            thousand individuals have personally enrolled as endorsers. This is truly a magnificent
            record and an achievement of which we can all be justly proud.</p>
        <p>But this interest, which has been so splendidly focused on birth control legislation, is
            only the prelude. The National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control has
            done what it set out to do; it has fought a good fight and won. Wider activities are
            before us. The younger men and women, whose energies have only just been aroused, and
            who are “all set to go,” must be organized for action, younger leaders must pass from
            the task of clearing away obstacles to the concrete program of founding clinics and
            establishing birth control as a public health service.</p>
        <p>In <place>India</place> I heard the proverb: “<q who="UNK">Knowledge is to know what to
                do, skill is knowing how to do it, virtue is doing it.</q>” Our future activities
            will, with your help, bring to the birth control movement, not only knowledge and skill,
            but virtue as well.</p>
        <p>The next issue of the NEWS will contain more definite details about these activities.</p>
