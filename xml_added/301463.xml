<p><person reg="Anonymous">M. S. L.</person> The best person to advise you in regard to Birth
Control is your doctor. As you evidently need such advice, go to him and ask him. If he is unable or
unwilling to help you, write to me again, and send your address.</p>
<p>
<person reg="Anonymous">G. B.</person> asks if two children are the right number for parents to
have. It is impossible to give a yes or no answer to this question. The number in a family should be
in accordance with the health of the mother, with the income and circumstances of the family, and
with the desires of the parents. Some women ought not to have children at all. Others may welcome
and care adequately for four or even more.</p>
<p>Here are two questions about the opposition of the Roman Catholics to Birth Control:</p>
<p><person reg="Anonymous">I. D. N.</person> asks: "<q who="UNK">Have you a pamphlet answering the
Catholics?</q>"</p>
<p>My reply is that I have never been able to find out what there is to answer. If I. D. N. will
send me their objections, I will be glad to try to meet them.</p>
<p><person reg="Anonymous">F. McM.</person> writes: "<q who="UNK">Why do the Catholics object to
Birth Control?</q>"</p>
<p>All I can say is, I don't know. I would like to find out.</p>
