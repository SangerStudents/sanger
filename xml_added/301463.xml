<p><person>M. S. L.</person>  The best person to advise you in regard
to Birth Control is your doctor.  As you evidently need such advice,
go to him and ask him.  If he is unable or unwilling to help you,
write to me again, and send your address.</p>
<p>	<person>G. B.</person> asks if two children are the right number
for parents to have.  It is impossible to give a yes or no answer to
this question.  The number in a family should be in accordance with
the health of the mother, with the income and circumstances of the
family, and with the desires of the parents.  Some women ought not to
have children at all.  Others may welcome and care adequately for four
or even more.</p>
<p>Here are two questions about the opposition of the Roman Catholics
to Birth Control:</p>
<p><person>I. D. N.</person> asks:  "<q who="UNK">Have you a pamphlet
answering the Catholics?</q>"</p>
<p>My reply is that I have never been able to find out what there is
to answer.  If I. D. N. will send me their objections, I will be glad
to try to meet them.</p>
<p><person>F. McM.</person> writes:  "<q who="UNK">Why do the Catholics
object to Birth Control?</q>"</p>
<p>All I can say is, I don't know.  I would like to find out.</p>
