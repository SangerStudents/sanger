        <head>WOMEN ENSLAVED BY MATERNITY</head>
        <byline>: By Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET SANGER</person>, Editor, American
                "<title type="journal">Birth Control Review</title>," in an interview.</byline>
        <div>
            <p><place reg="Great Britain">Britain</place>, like <place reg="United States"
                    >America</place>, is now in a condition in which the wealthy people, and even
                those of moderate means, are practising the principles of birth control. Their
                birth-rate is practically stationary. It is the people living in poverty and
                disease, who, though less adapted for bringing into existence healthy, sturdy
                children, are having large families.</p>
            <p>I believe that the time is ripe to make birth control a national issue in this
                country, first of all because woman is anxious to take her place in the social and
                political life of the nation. This she can never do while she is enslaved by the
                function of maternity.</p>
            <p>She wants to have a share in social and political movements, but no woman who is
                bringing children into the world year after year can possibly take a real interest
                in matters outside the domestic circle.</p>
            <p>It is a striking fact that the increase in the feeble-minded in Britain is even
                greater than in America. Whereas in America the feeble-minded mother gives birth to
                three times as many children as the normal mother, the disparity is four to one in
                this country.</p>
            <p>If this continues, it is going to mean a very inferior race within the next
                generation.</p>
            <p>Organised labour is very strong in Britain, and has a programme which should achieve
                success if birth control is included in its scope. But the labour movement cannot
                possibly attain the state of society which it is aiming at while those within it
                continue to bring hordes of human beings into the world which no system that man has
                so far devised can assimilate. On the other hand, if the workers will begin at once
                to bring forth only those children which are wanted by the women and can be
                maintained by the father's labour, the working class of this country may realise
                their dreams of a better state of society within a generation, and be the first
                among the nation to attain their goal. At present any work on social lines among the
                poor is simply a palliative. We have got to strike at the roots of our social evils,
                and birth control is the only automatic cure for all social problems.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH SIDE.</head>
            <p>But there is a health side as well as an economic side to this question. There is the
                important factor of a woman's self-development and her right to control her own
                body.</p>
            <p>In a well-balanced society where we desire quality rather than quantity we shall not
                have the "unwanted child," whether the mother be a millionairess or a poor woman.
                The loved child, however, will be the greatest asset to any nation.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it would be as well to explain how I came to take an interest in the question
                of birth control. For fourteen years I worked as a trained nurse in the slum areas
                of <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>. I came in daily contact with the
                terrific human waste of children and of mothers--children who died before they were
                a year old, 90 per cent. Through poverty and neglect, and mothers who died from
                causes due to ignorant maternity.</p>
            <p>Our information is only given to married women, and preferably to those who are
                already mothers. And let objectors remember that fear and ignorance are not
                conducive to the highest morality. Just as knowledge or any useful implement might
                be used for destructive purposes, so the information we disseminate is open to
                abuse. The case of the razor may be cited as an illustration. This useful adjunct of
                civilised life was once violently objected to because it was claimed that if razors
                came into the possession of men who were not doctors they would be tempted to kill
                one another. But we have gradually taught the proper use of razors without any such
                disastrous consequences. So it is with birth control information.</p>
            <p>We are endeavouring to stimulate and encourage the proper use of knowledge which we
                believe to be necessary to the highest happiness of humanity.</p>
