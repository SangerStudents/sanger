        <head>REINCARNATION</head>
        <p>REINCARNATION briefly is the teaching that each soul goes through many lives on this
            Earth-Plane, and so adapted to its needs, that each affords new lessons, and new
            opportunities for Growth and Development. In the periods between Incarnations, the Soul
            is on the Cosmic Plane. Less developed Souls spend this period in a dream state, others
            as they Progress, spend more and more time in Conscious Work and Growth. As the end of
            its Cycle approaches the soul is drawn again to earth, entering the body of a new born
            child with the first breath the infant takes. The time and place are such as yet afford
            this Soul the lessons it needs to learn in its progress back to the First Cause from
            which it came. There is no other logical reason that can be given, considering the
            Universe as ruled by Law and Order, by a God of Love, which will explain the
            inequalities in the lives we see all around us. Some have Wealth, Health, Happiness
            thrust upon them, others through no fault of their own, apparently, have suffering, and
            sorrow, misery poverty, and disease as their lot.</p>
        <p>Again there is the apparent futility, of life with its lessons, if just as we have
            learned something of them, we die and pass onto a place called Heaven, where the things
            we have learned are of no further use to us; I am giving you briefly, short sketches of
            the various ideas presented, and I want you to ponder long and earnestly over the
            subject until you work it out in your mind, with the aid of the help that will come to
            you as you sit in your Sanctum and mediate upon it.</p>
        <p>Reincarnation is a logical explanation of earthly conditions, and the inequalities we
            find. If we know that each Soul has lived many lives on this Plane and that it has
            failed to learn many lessons it should have learned, then we see why the Eternal Law of
            Compensation demands Justice. We see that the Soul which expresses cruelty is brought
            again and again into conditions which will, through its own suffering, teach it the
            lesson of Love and Kindness. And so like little children, when the day is done at
            school, we go home and come again in the morning--some to take up the new lessons, and
            some who have failed yesterday find a new chance is given to them to review the old
            work, and finally they, too, pass on to other work. Humanity learned in the past through
            misery and suffering brought upon them by their infraction of the Law; now some are
            learning from the experience of others, thus avoiding much of the penalty they could
            otherwise bring upon themselves. As the Souls in the Cosmic feel the first influx of
            Negative Matter and sink slowly earthward for another experience on this Plane, it is a
            kindly Law that drugs the senses, so they lose memory of that Cosmic World they are
            leaving for a time, and are thus free and unhindered to take up the lessons before them.
