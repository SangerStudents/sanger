        <head>The Function of Sterilization</head>
        <head type="sub">Part of an address delivered by Margaret Sanger before the <org>Institute
                of Euthenics</org> at <org>Vassar College</org> August 5th</head>
        <p>The Question of race betterment is one of immediate concern, and I am glad to say that
            the <place>United States</place>
            <org reg="United States Government">Government</org> has already taken certain steps to
            control the equality of our population through the drastic immigration laws.</p>
        <p>There is a quota restriction by which only so many people from each country are allowed
            to enter our shores each month. It is the latest method adopted by our government to
            solve the population problem. Most people are convinced that this policy is right, and
            agree that we should slow down on the number as well as the kind of immigrants coming
            here.</p>
        <p>But while we close our gates to the co-called “undesirables” from other countries, we
            make no attempt to discourage or cut down the rapid multiplication of the unfit and
            undesirable at home.</p>
        <p>In fact through our archaic and inhuman laws against Birth Control information the
            breeding of defectives and insane becomes a necessity.</p>
        <p>These types are being multiplied with break-neck rapidity and increasing far out of
            proportion to the normal and intelligent classes. In 1923 over nine billions of dollars
            were spent on state and federal charities for the care and maintenance and perpetuation
            of these undesirables. Year by year their numbers are mounting. Year by year their cost
            is increasing. Huge sums -- yes, vast fortunes -- are expended on these, while the
            normal parents and their children are compelled to shift for themselves and compete with
            each other.</p>
        <p>The American public is taxed, heavily taxed, to maintain an increasing race of morons,
            which threatens the very foundations of our civilization.</p>
        <p>Over one-quarter of the total income of the state of <place>New York</place> is spent on
            the maintenance of asylums, prisons, and other institutions for the care of the
            defective and the diseased. It must not be assumed that all the undesirable breeders are
            segregated in institutions. There is only a very small proportion of the feebleminded
            given over to institutions, the vast majority are living their lives among us,
            propagating their kind and providing abundant opportunity for the continuation of
            charities and various pauperizing institutions for generations to come.</p>
        <p>When we view the political situation and realize that a moron’s vote is as good as an
            intelligent, educated, thinking citizen, we may well pause and ask ourselves: “Is
            America really safe for democracy?”</p>
        <p>In <place>England</place> a few weeks ago the <org reg="United Kingdom House of Lords"
                >House of Lords</org> passed a resolution sanctioning the giving of contraceptive
            instruction in all the maternity centers supported by the government.</p>
        <p>It now remains for the United States government to set a sensible example to the world by
            offering a bonus or a yearly pension to all obviously unfit parents who allow themselves
            to be sterilized by harmless and scientific means. In this way the moron and the
            diseased would have no posterity to inherit their unhappy condition. The number of the
            feebleminded would decrease and a heavy burden would be lifted from the shoulders of the
            fit.</p>
        <p>Such a bonus would be a wise and profitable investment for the nation. It would be the
            salvation of American civilization. It would enable thousands of parents to get a firm
            footing on the path of life and enable them to give some care to those children they
            have already borne.</p>
        <p>It would mean facing our debts today, here and now, instead of passing them on and piling
            them up for future generations to pay.</p>
        <p>Our statistics tell us that the birth rate of the college men and women is lower than it
            should be. This applies to all the professional classes, doctors, clergymen, lawyers and
            skilled workers. There are some who deplore this condition and would remedy it by
            abusive epithets hurled at this conscientious group of decent and responsible citizens,
            who would rather have only the umber of children they can decently rear, than to enter a
            cradle competition with the less responsible.</p>
        <p>There is only one reply to a request for a higher birth rate among the intelligent, and
            that is to ask the government to <emph rend="italics">first</emph> take off the burdens
            of the insane and feebleminded from your backs. Sterilization for these is your
            remedy.</p>
