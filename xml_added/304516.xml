<head>Birth Control: <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>'s Reply to <person
reg="Roosevelt, Theodore">Theodore Roosevelt</person></head>
<byline>Respectfully Yours, Margaret H. Sanger</byline>
<p>The trouble with nearly all writers who oppose birth control is that they consider only proximate
instead of ultimate effects. They want large numbers of high quality citizens. Therefore, they
contend, let the existing high quality citizens have more children. They assume that families now
living in comfortable circumstances will be able to maintain their standards, no matter how many
additional children are born. In other words, they expect quality to take care of itself.</p>

<p>We advocates of birth control know that one cannot make quality by insisting on quantity. One
cannot make <emph rend="italics"> better</emph> people simply by having <emph rend="italics">
more</emph> people.</p>

<p>Mr. Roosevelt says that in order to make a man into a better citizen, we must first have the man.
The right environment in which to receive and develop the man is of great importance. Society, as at
present constituted, does not provide the means of rearing unrestricted hordes of human beings into
intelligent citizenship. Therefore, birth control has become necessary as a check upon the blind
working of ignorance and poverty.</p>

<p>When considering the problems of the class known as the "submerged tenth," even the most
conservative are willing to admit its need of birth control. But it is an error to suppose that the
proportion of families sunk in destitution constitutes only one-tenth of the population. Figures are
available to prove that it is closer to three-tenths, or well over one quarter. The census of 1910
shows that 10.7 per cent of married women in the <place reg="United States"> United States</place>
went to work outside their homes to help keep their families together. There, without looking
farther, is a submerged tenth among the women alone. There is little doubt that the proportion of
wage-earning mothers has greatly increased since 1910, and it is equally beyond question that an
enormous number of poverty-stricken women are prevented by their excessive family burdens from
seeking to earn money outside the home.</p>

<p>They who ban the open and legal dissemination of birth control practically say--Let the slums
spawn if they must; the prime aim is to goad the upper classes into greater fertility. Both effects
are deplorable. There is no greater national waste than the spawning of the slums, with its
resultant high maternal and infant mortality rates, child labor and prostitution. As for increasing
the fertility of the upper classes, it is certain that the majority of such parents even now have as
many children as any rational eugenist could ask them to do were he in possession of all the facts
of each case--health, income, educational needs and provision for the future, etc. Admitting that
they give birth to fewer children, the fact is that they bring to maturity almost as many,
relatively, as the poor succeed in doing. The following figures prepared by the French authority,
Dr. <person reg="Bertillon, Jacques">J. Bertillon</person>, demonstrate this point.</p>

<p>For the whole of <place>France</place>, 86.6 per cent of the children of rich parents reach
twenty years of age, and only 48.6 per cent of the children of poor parents. The figures for <person
reg="Paris, France"> Paris</person> give a fertility rate of about 100 births per 1,000 poor
mothers, and of about 50 per 1,000 rich mothers. Combining these with the former figures, it appears
that for each 1,000 rich mothers there would be 43.3 children surviving to twenty years annually,
and for each 1,000 poor mothers only 48.6 children. In France, as elsewhere, the poor mother is
handicapped in rearing her surviving offspring. This results in a percentage of unfitness, and the
contribution of the high birth-rate classes to the adult effective population is, consequently, no
higher proportionately than that of the low birth-rate classes.</p>

<p>The world over, the intelligent parents of three children or less have been, and are, the
upholders of national standards. This is particularly true of America.</p>

<p>By regarding the bringing of a child into the world as a great social responsibility, the modern
American woman shows a fine sense of morality. Since the State does not compel marriage, but leaves
it to individual choice, she does not see why motherhood, which is a much more serious problem,
should be enforced.</p>

<p>The American woman of today is physically and nervously unable to compete with her grandmother in
the matter of bearing unlimited offspring. In Colonial times, the environment was favorable and
women specialized on reproduction with eminent success. The prospective mothers of this generation
are compelled to divide their creative energies between child bearing and social and economic
complexities. It has been estimated that last year seven and a half million women were engaged in
industry in the United States, the majority of them in nerve-racking trades. Ten hours a day at a
sewing machine or a telephone switchboard are not conducive to either a physical or mental
receptiveness to maternity.</p>

<p>It is a very common fallacy that the decadence of <place>Greece</place> and <place
reg="Roman Empire">Rome</place> was due to the artificial limitation of offspring. It is surprising
to find a historian like Mr. Roosevelt repeating the error. During the periods he refers to, birth
control was, indeed, practised, and as a result some of the greatest poets, thinkers and geniuses,
generally, of that, or any other age, were developed. Birth Control was one of the few serious moral
forces at work tending to preserve the integrity of the State. But, in Rome, at all events, it was
not quite effective enough to combat the soft luxury and vice which had come as an aftermath of an
orgy of conquest. </p>

<p>The failing birth rate of college graduates, as demonstrated by the statistics gathered in <org
reg="Harvard University">Harvard</org> and <org reg="Yale University">Yale</org> by <person
reg="Phillips, John C.">John C. Phillips</person>, should not be considered alarming. The best thing
that the modern American college does for the young men or women is to make of them highly
sensitized individuals, keenly aware of their responsibility to society. They quickly perceive that
they have other duties toward the State than procreation of the kind blindly practised by the
immigrant from <place>Europe</place>. They cannot be deluded into thinking quantity superior to
quality. But they can be trusted not to suffer extinction. The operation of natural law will prevent
the ratio of reproduction from remorselessly falling to zero. In this, as in all other population
phenomena, a new level of fertility is being sought- that is all.</p>

<p>In many other isolated groups, the same process can be observed today. The editor of <title
type="journal">The Journal of Heredity</title> has found that out of 1,512 families of Methodist
ministers in America, the average number of children is now only 3.12. The birth rate in the
<org>English Society of Friends</org> has fallen from 20 per 1,000 in 1876 to less than 8 per 1,000
in 1915. Or, to take an illustration from an entire racial group, statistics show that the size of
Jewish families in Europe has been rapidly decreasing since 1876. They contain now only two to four
children, with a growing tendency to restrict the number to two, whilst only twenty years ago they
had four to six. </p>

<p>But it is well to emphasize that we advocates of birth control are not so much disturbed by the
stationary birth rate of the thinking classes, as by the reckless propagation of the ignorant. We
consider that the falling birth rate is a wold-wide movement of civilization.</p>

<p>Mr. Roosevelt quotes approvingly the statement of a French newspaper that the present war was
really due to the increasing birth rate of <place>Germany</place> and the falling birth rate of
France. Had Germany to face 60,000,000 Frenchmen, instead of 39,000,000, this authority holds, the
war would not have taken place. In my opinion, two over-populated nations would have fought even
more readily and long before. The war was due to the over-populated nations would have fought even
more readily and long before. The war was due to the over-population of Germany and <place
reg="Soviet Union">Russia</place>, not to France's stationary population. But once put to the
ordeal, the French soldiers, sturdy and highly individualistic because they came from small
families, proved at the Battle of the Marne and <place reg="Verdun, France"> Verdun</place> the
efficacy of birth control, by defeating an enemy mechanically much more formidable than
themselves.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the same Germany who had failed against France easily routed the hordes of
Russian soldiers, who owed their numbers to an unlimited system of reckless propagation. Germany's
birth rate is falling. In 1860 it was 37.9 per thousand inhabitants and in 1912 only 29.1. It is
common knowledge that the economists of Europe do not hope for universal peace until the birth rate
of Russia also begins to decline.</p>

<p>The intelligent class, with its acceptance of birth control, holds the same position in American
society that France does among the nations of the world.</p>

<p>It is an error to suppose that woman avoids motherhood because she is afraid to die. Rather does
she fear to live. She fears a life of poverty and drudgery, weighed down by the horror of unwanted
pregnancy and tortured by the inability to rear decently the children she has already brought into
the world.</p>
