        <head>WHAT EVERY GIRL SHOULD KNOW</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET H. SANGER</person>. </byline>
        <head type="sub">Sexual Impulse- Part I. </head>
        <p>The sexual impulse is the strongest force in all living creatures. It is this that
            animates the struggle for existence; it is this that attracts and unites two beings,
            that they may reproduce their kind; it is this that inspires man to the highest and
            noblest thoughts; it is this also that inspires man to all endeavors and achievements,
            to all art and poetry; this impulse is the creative instinct which dominates all living
            things and without which life must die. If, then, this force, this impulse plays so
            strong a part in our lives, is it not necessary that we know something of it?</p>
        <p>At the time of puberty there comes both to boys and girls two impulses--one, the desire
            to touch and caress; to come in contact with, to write and to speak to an individual of
            the opposite sex. This impulse is much stronger in girls than in boys. The other is the
            impulse that impels the individual to discharge the accumulation of ripe sex cells, and
            relieve himself of the nervous tension which this accumulation produces. This latter
            impulse is stronger in boys than in girls. One writer states that this is an unconscious
            desire for relief from physical congestion, not differing greatly from the sense of
            relief which the emptying of the bladder or rectum produces.</p>
        <p>These two impulses together constitute the Sexual Impulse, and this constitutes the
            foundation upon which love, the greatest of all emotions, is based.</p>
        <p>At the time of puberty, we learned from the last article, that the first manifestations
            of sexual maturity in the girl is the appearance of the menstrual flow. But also at
            puberty there comes the sexual impulse, which evidences itself during sleep, in a filmy
            substance dropping from the mouth of the uterus. This "demunescense" does not appear
            very often in young girls, but later in life when sex instinct becomes stronger it
            occurs during sleep, especially in young widows, or women having experienced sexual
            relations. They are, however, seldom aware of its taking place; consequently, it has not
            the danger which it presents to the boy.</p>
        <p>In the preceding article on puberty, we discussed only the girl at puberty, but here it
            is necessary to understand that during puberty many changes take place in the boy, such
            as change of voice, the growth of hair on various parts of the body, and most important,
            the discharge of the sexual fluid commonly known as seminal emissions. This latter
            symptom appears in every normal healthy boy on reaching the age of puberty, but unlike
            the menstrual period which occurs at a stated period in girls, the seminal emissions do
            not depend upon a special period; they occur at different times, usually twice a month.
            This expulsion is considered perfectly normal, and is not a sign of physical or sexual
            weakness, but a sign that a surplus accumulation of ripe sex cells are present and have
            come to their full development and overflow. Nature takes care of this and uses all of
            this life giving fluid according to the needs of the individual, casting off the
            surplus.</p>
        <p>It is this symptom that alarms young boys at puberty. It is this overflow which enables
            quack doctors to play upon the innocent and ignorant boy, telling him that it is an
            indication of weakness. And it is also this--as the result of telling older boys about
            it--that leads boys to houses of prostitution; for they are told by their ignorant
            advisers that they must have sexual relations or endanger their sexual capacity.</p>
        <p>It is also this overflow which, occurring in sleep, awakens the boy, and he is conscious
            of what has occurred; he is conscious also of a pleasurable sensation which this sense
            of relief produces, and unless warned against it he will try at some later time to bring
            on this relief by friction or mechanical means, which is known as masturbation -- often
            called self-abuse. The age of puberty is one of the periods in an individual's life in
            which it is easiest to acquire this habit, in girls as well as in boys, although the
            girl may not be conscious of any sensation, through the accumulation of the
            "demunescense." Yet there is the same nervous tension that exists in boys, due to
            congestion of the now fully developed genital organs, perhaps slighter in intensity, but
            it is there and becomes conscious of it.</p>
        <p>In talking to older girls about sex, menstruation, etc., she is often led into the habit
            of masturbation. Cases have been known where children formed this habit in infancy
            almost, through the ignorance of nurses or even mothers, who, not aware of consequences,
            have kept babies from crying by gently patting or rubbing the sexual parts. It may be
            caused also by uncleanliness, itching, tight clothing, etc.</p>
        <p>When the habit is formed in very small children, it can be exercised in the very presence
            of the parents, but they being ignorant of the habit itself, or the consequences,
            interpret the actions as "baby ways." Again, the habit is formed upon entering school.
            It is said no school is free from it; and it is a fact that no institution today is free
            from pupils who practice masturbation.</p>
        <p>In public schools are found groups of perverted boys and girls whose depraved ideas
            sooner or later permeate the place. A recent issue of a <org reg="Ladies Home Journal"
                >conservative woman's journal</org> says: "<q who="LHJ">In absolute filth of
                conversation nothing could quite equal the talk of boys and girls during recess in
                our schools. What is still worse is that the child is generally instructed in
                masturbation, prostitution and sometimes sexual perversity.</q>"</p>
        <p>This subject of masturbation is at present under discussion from many points of view
            among the medical profession; some claiming, that, as with venereal diseases, we lay too
            much stress on the matter, and exaggerate the harm done to the individual by it. One
            writer plainly states that it is of such common practice that out of a hundred young men
            and women, ninety-nine are addicted to it, and the hundredth one is lying. Another says
            that out of a hundred men and women arriving at the age of 25, ninety-nine have
            practiced it at some time.</p>
        <p>Moreover, it is said to be practiced by people of nearly every race on the globe, and
            even by animals when sexually aroused and their mates are not near. By these examples
            such writers would try to prove that because ninety-nine people out of one hundred are
            not in insane asylums the practice cannot be as harmful as is stated by others to
            be.</p>
        <p>Let us take a sane and logical view of this subject and arrive at a decided
            conclusion.</p>
        <p>In children before they have reached the age of puberty, prior to the development of the
            sexual organs, it stands to reason that to abuse these organs before they are strong
            enough to be exercised must weaken them for their natural functions. Again, masturbation
            unlike the sexual act, can be practiced individually and at all times and nearly
            anywhere. This gives the individual unlimited opportunity for indulgence, and
            consequently drains and exhausts the system of the vitality necessary for full
            development.</p>
        <p>In the boy or girl past puberty we find one of the most dangerous forms of masturbation,
            i.e., mental masturbation, which consist of forming mental pictures, or thinking of
            obscene or voluptuous pictures. This form is considered especially harmful to the brain,
            for the habit becomes so fixed that it is almost impossible to free the thoughts from
            lustful pictures. Every girl should guard against the man who invariably turns a word or
            sentence into a lustful, or commonly termed, "smutty" channel, for nine times out of ten
            he is a mental masturbator.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the greatest physical danger to the chronic masturbator is the inability to
            perform the sexual act naturally. The strong physical irritants which are used are
            likely to produce catarrhal disease of these organs in both sexes, producing such
            irritating sensations that relief is demanded, and this can be obtained only by
            repeating the habit, and so it continues. The individual promises himself over and over
            again after such exercises to overcome the habit, but his will power gradually becomes
            destroyed and the impulse continues. He knows and intuitively feels such practice
            degrades him and destroys his character; he feels he is losing control of himself, and
            also realizes that his health, especially his nervous system, is being undermined.</p>
        <p>In my personal experience as a trained nurse while attending persons afflicted with
            various and often revolting diseases, no matter what their ailments, I never found any
            one so repulsive as the chronic masturbator.</p>
        <p>It would not be difficult to fill page upon page of heart-rending confessions made by
            young girls, whose lives were blighted by this pernicious habit, always begun so
            innocently.</p>
        <p>Before closing this subject, however, I want to tell of a case of an 8-year-old boy I
            attended during an attack of measles. I found he was shy and unresponsive, and at times
            very nervous and irritable, with a strong liking to be alone. I observed him closely for
            a few days and reported the results of my observation to the attending physician. He was
            convinced of their truth, that the little fellow was masturbating. The physician
            assigned to me the task of talking to the child, who acknowledged that he was "touching"
            himself and had been ever since he could remember. The little fellow's mother had died
            when he was in infancy, leaving beside himself a brother a year older with whom he
            slept. I explained to him the danger as well as I could and the result was that I was
            awakened in the night by whisperings and found the little fellow asking the older
            brother to tie his hands to the bedpost. This the older brother did with a handkerchief,
            and the child went to sleep in this way every night during the few weeks I was attending
            him. The first few nights he was awake practically all of the time struggling to
            overcome this habit, which he finally overcame completely.</p>
        <p>At puberty every boy and girl should be taught these dangers and temptations and also how
            to avoid them, by keeping active, mentally and physically, going to bed only when
            sleepy, avoiding intoxicating drinks and stimulants.</p>
        <p>We have strayed some distance, I know, from the beginning of our subject--Sexual
            Impulse--to treat of its perversion (masturbation), but next week we shall again take up
            the normal natural impulse and see what there is that every girl should know.</p>
