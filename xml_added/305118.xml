        <head>BIRTH CONTROL IN AMERICA.</head>
        <p>There appears to be a movement on foot at present in <place reg="United States"
                >America</place> which if successful will be the first vital step toward the
            overthrow of Puritanism, as well as the slow but certain downfall of Comstockery in that
            country. It is the Birth Control movement, and it has grown so rapidly in favor and
            strength during the past few months that in <place reg="New York, NY">New York
                City</place> alone there are two separate Birth Control Leagues--one consisting of
            members of the medical profession, and the other mainly of feminists and people of
            feminist sympathies.</p>
        <p>It is now over forty years since there were placed on the Statute Book of the United
            States Government laws rushed through an uproarious and hurried <org
                reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> in the last hour of March 3 (new
            Administrations assume duties March 4), known as the "Comstock Laws," which prohibited
            any matter passing through the mails which, in the opinion of <person
                reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony Comstock</person>, was "obscene." This implied a
            religious as well as moral opinion.</p>
        <p><person reg="Ingersoll, Robert G.">Robert G. Ingersoll</person> and his followers arose
            at once to strike a deadly blow at the religious part of the law, and succeeded so well
            that a few years later the law was modified, and religious prejudice was removed. Let it
            be understood that it was not removed from the Statute Book until after there was no use
            for it. Ingersoll's propaganda against the Church and religion was so effective and
            widespread that by direct action and education, he undermined the Church at its very
            foundation, and left the stupid law hanging in <place reg="Washington, DC"
                >Washington</place> like the dried shell of a tortoise. When there was no use or no
            further interest in the law, the lawmakers secretly removed that portion of it. But they
            tightened their grip harder than ever on the moral side of it, and in case the word
            "obscene" should be too vague, they stipulated its meaning, and combined the causing of
            abortion and the prevention of conception under one title, "obscene," and threatened
            five years' imprisonment and a five-thousand dollar fine for any one who was found
            guilty of this offense. The consequence has been that though many have broken it by
            sending through the mail papers, magazines, etc., with nude figures in their pages, and
            have been prosecuted for "obscenity," only one besides myself has openly defied this
            outrageous law on the prevention of conception. This was <person reg="Elliot, Dr.">Dr.
                Elliott</person>, an honored member of the medical profession, who, seeing the
            suffering of poor and miserable women, stated he would defy the law and give out this
            information to those who needed it. A few days later he received two letters from
            different towns asking for his advice--one writer saying she was the mother of nine
            children and had a syphilitic husband, the other saying she had ten children and a
            husband out of work through illness. Dr. Elliott sent the necessary information to both
            writers. The following week he was arrested, dragged off to jail, and confronted by a
            woman, a Comstock spy, as the one who had written to him in both cases. He was tried,
            found guilty, and sentenced to five years in the <org>Leavenworth Penitentiary</org> for
                <emph rend="italics">each</emph> letter, and a ten-thousand dollar fine. He got the
            limit of the law. He served six years, but through some agitation recently aroused, he
            has been "pardoned," and allowed to go free.</p>
        <p>Broken in health and spirit, with his professional standing practically gone, his case
            has stood like a giant rock for the authorities, and held the medical profession and
            others alike at bay.</p>
        <p>I had no desire to become a martyred Dr. Elliott, but I harbored a burning desire to
            undermine that law, not by waiting to vote it out of existence, but by crushing it out
            by action, for direct action will bring results that a generation of political action
            could never do.</p>
        <p>In March, 1914, I brought out a monthly paper, the <title type="journal">Woman
                Rebel</title>, which had on its banner, "No Gods, No Masters," and had for its
            motto, "Working women, build up within yourselves a conscious fighting character against
            all things which enslave you." It claimed that women's first right is over her own body,
            to be a mother or not as she saw fit; but such rights involved a knowledge of the means
            to prevent conception. The columns were thrown open for opinions, and letters poured in
            thick and fast from all over America. Seven out of nine issues were suppressed and
            confiscated by the Government, and in August the Federal grand jury returned a verdict
            against me of three indictments on twelve counts, or a liability of twelve years'
            imprisonment. But I had no intention to undergo imprisonment for simply discussing a
            subject. There was already printed, and waiting in storage in various parts of the
            United States, a pamphlet giving direct information on family limitation. The
            authorities heard of this, and were anxious to push my trial on the pending indictment,
            and hoped to frighten or discourage me from doing any further work on the subject. The
            trial came up in October, and I asked for a postponement to prepare my case. The <person
                reg="Hazel, John Raymond">Judge</person> refused it, saying I had had time enough to
            prepare it. I then took my own postponement, and left for <place>Europe</place>. Three
            days later there were one hundred thousand pamphlets on family limitation passing
            through the mails into the various industrial sections of the country.</p>
        <p>The fact that I am a middle-aged, motherly, harmless-looking person, led the Judge to
            allow me to go without bail, so that my leaving the country made the authorities quite
            furious. They cleverly laid a trap by sending a <person reg="Bamberger, Charles"
                >man</person> calling himself a "comrade" to Mr. <person reg="Sanger, William"
                >Sanger</person>'s studio. This man showed great interest in my work, and after a
            second call of friendly interest got Mr. Sanger to give him one of the pamphlets on
                "<title type="pamphlet">Family Limitation</title>." He left the studio, and in a few
            minutes returned with Anthony Comstock, who had a warrant for Mr. Sanger's arrest, and a
            warrant to search his premises, which was done. </p>
        <p>They then tried to induce him to tell of my whereabouts and my plans, on the promise of
            leniency; failing that, he was taken to jail and locked up until bail could be found for
            him. His case is still pending. The <org>Free Speech League</org> has taken it up, and
            are trying to get it tried before a jury. It will no doubt be held over until the
            October Court opens. A few weeks following Mr. Sanger's arrest, some person or persons
            entered his studio, and a box of private letters written to him by me from Europe were
            mysteriously missing.</p>
        <p>In the meantime a tremendous indignation swept the country at Mr. Sanger's arrest, and
            brought with it an overwhelming interest in the subject of birth control. At last the
            great conspiracy of silence on this subject was broken, and the capitalist press took it
            up from all sides. One conservative daily has offered a prize of £5 for the best letter
            on the subject of family limitation.</p>
        <p>As I near the conclusion of the work which I came to Europe to do, the thought naturally
            comes to me, "Shall I return to America, and stand trial for these indictments?" We who
            know the State and its machinery, know that it is not built upon reason, or justice, or
            upon a desire for human welfare. We know it maintains its hold upon us by force, and for
            me to return and expect to reason with a Government which knows no reason, seems a
            childlike act.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there is the danger of this movement being transferred from the
            control of the State to the control of the medical profession, which in reality is only
            an exchange of high priests--another Church which the workers must pass through with
            bended knees before they can get to the knowledge that rightly belongs to them. It is my
            desire that such knowledge should be available to every adult man and woman, but
            especially to the <emph rend="italics">working</emph> men and women. </p>
        <p>There have been so many letters come to me these last few weeks urging my return, and
            requesting me to take up the working class side of the fight, and fight the case against
            a growing tendency of class liberty and class privilege, that I have decided to return
            to America in the latter part of the summer, and stand my trial. </p>
        <p>I am not fooling myself by thinking that the same magazines and press which are
            advocating the idea of birth control by legal means are going to stand behind any one
            who defied and deliberately broke a sacred law and advocated it by direct means. I know
            too well the methods of the cowardly press, and expect <emph rend="italics"
                >little</emph> from them. But in a country where there is the latest scientific
            invention, and most up-to-date machinery, if there exists by its side laws which execute
            ideals, and burn at the stake those who dare to speak and act for freedom, then it is
            time such places were exposed, and their much-boasted freedom and liberty
            challenged.</p>
