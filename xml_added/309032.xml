        <head>NOT GUILTY!</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret H. Sanger</person></byline>
        <p>There seems to be considerable misapprehension among those who are interested in my
            coming trial. Many are under the impression that the indictments pending are for
            circulation of the forbidden information. This, of course, is not true. I have been
            indicted under <name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Section
                211 of the Federal criminal code</name> for alleged obscenity. They were issued
            against me as editor and publisher of <title type="journal">The Woman Rebel</title>. My
            "crime" is not in giving the information, but solely for advocating birth control. The
            are three indictments, based on twelve articles, eleven of which are for <emph
                rend="italics">printing the words</emph>--"prevention of conception." To the elect
            of federal officialdom these words themselves are considered lewd, lascivious and
            obscene. In none of these articles is any information given--simply discussions of the
            subject, addressed to the working women of this country.</p>
        <p>Many "radical" advisers have assured me that the wisest course to follow in fighting the
            case would be to plead "guilty" to this "obscenity" charge, and to throw myself upon the
            mercy of the court, which would mean, according to those familiar with the
            administration of "justice," a light sentence or a light fine.</p>
        <p>It is unfortunate that so many radicals and so-called revolutionists have failed to
            understand that my object in this work has been to remove, or to try to remove, the term
            "prevention of conception" from this section of the penal code, where it has been
            labeled by our wise legislators as filthy, vile and obscene, and to obtain deserved
            currency for this valuable idea and practice.</p>
        <p>The problem of staying out of jail or being sent to jail is merely incidental in this
            fight. It is discouraging to find that advanced revolutionists of this country are
            frantically trying to save agitators from jail sentences thereby losing sight of the
            real and crucial issues of the fight. If we could depend upon a strong and consistently
            revolutionary support in such battles, instead of weakened efforts to effect a
            compromise with the courts, there would be much greater stimulation for individuals to
            enter revolutionary activity.</p>
        <p>To evade the issue in this case, as I have been advised, would mean to leave matters as
            they have been since 1872. But it is time for the people of this country to find out if
            the <place>United States</place> mails are to be available for their use, as they, in
            their adult intelligence may desire, or is it possible for the <org>United States post
                office</org> to constitute itself an institution for the promulgation of stupidity
            and ignorant tyranny.</p>
        <p>The first step in the birth control movement or any other propaganda requiring a free
            press is to open the mails to the people of this country, regardless of class. Nothing
            can be accomplished without the free and open discussion of any subject.</p>
        <p>These indictments have had the effect of opening the discussion of birth control in
            magazines and papers of the most conservative nature, whose editors would have been
            horrified at the subject previous to my arrest.</p>
        <p>When my case is called in the Federal courts I shall enter a plea of "not guilty," in
            order to separate the idea of prevention of conception and birth control from the sphere
            of pornography, from the gutter of slime and filth where the lily-livered legislators
            have placed it, under the direction of the late unlamented <person
                reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony Comstock</person>, and in which the forces of
            reaction are still attempting to hold it.</p>
