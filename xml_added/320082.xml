            Children--Copyright, 1911.</head>
        <p>Little 5-year-old Bobby sat playing in the sand pile one lovely afternoon in May, and,
            judging by the glimpses his mother had of him through the open door of their cottage,
            his mind was to all appearances intent on making a sand fish perfect. For in and out the
            damp sand was thrown from the pile to the fish mold many times, until at last being
            perfect, at least to his satisfaction, he got up and ran to find his mother, who was
            busy within the small two-room shack where they were living for the summer.</p>
        <p>He caught hold of her apron to attract her attention, and said: "Mother, where did I
                come from?" </p>
        <p>Needless to say, his mother was greatly surprised at this question, just at that time,
            for she had not the faintest idea that his thoughts were on anything but the perfection
            of that sand fish. However, she quickly recovered from her surprise and taking his
            little face between her hands, said:</p>
        <p>"Bobby, dear, that is the most wonderful secret in all the world, and if you are quite
                sure you can keep this secret and only talk about it to father and mother, I'll tell
                you all about it."</p>
        <p>The curly head bobbed up and down in answer to this and as his eyes grew big and bright,
            he answered: </p>
        <p>"Do tell me the secret mother, I'll never tell."</p>
        <p>Then she told him that as soon as the dishes were put away, she would take him for a walk
            in the woods and first show him where the baby flowers come from, where the mother kept
            them when they were baby seeds and also tell him how the father and mother flower gave
            life to the little baby seeds, which afterward grew into the lovely flowers we see all
            about us.</p>
        <p>Bobby's mother now regretted that she had not begun earlier to tell this story of the
            flower to Bobby. For she realized that had she done this then, now when he had reached
            the stage of development where he was curious about his own being, she could at once
            have taken up the story of his own creation, and, of course, referred back to the story
            of the creation of the lower species. This would have simplified matters greatly.
            However, she decided it could never be too late and the easiest and quickest way, even
            now, was to begin with the flowers.</p>
        <p>It now occurred to Bobby's mother that to teach her child alone the truths of Nature
            would be a most fruitless task; for in playing with his companions, they would undo all
            her work unless they, too, were taught the truths, and in the same way.</p>
        <p>She consequently set about gathering in the children of the neighborhood with whom Bobby
            played. She explained to the mothers what she was about to do. Most of them strongly
            objected to their boys learning these things which they considered of interest only to
            grown-ups. But five of the mothers consented, and seemed delighted to have their
            children taught the truths in this most beautiful and interesting way.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, she took five little children, together with her own, ranging in age from
            five to six and one-half years and started in the woods to hunt for the common wild
            flowers. Soon they were scrambling over boulders and fallen trees in search of mountain
            pinks, violets, buttercups, anemones, etc., calling and shouting to each other at each
            new find, their faces bright and happy with the glow of health. It was a picture never
            to be forgotten; and as they gathered around Bobby's mother, who was seated on a most
            covered , fallen tree, they received their first lesson.</p>
        <p>As the buttercup was a little early - those on this particular outing being the first
            ones found of the season - they naturally made it the most popular flower and so it
            became logically the first family to be studied.</p>
        <p>They were told that the whole buttercup, as they held it, was the Buttercup House whose
            color was yellow, and that inside the house, on the petals, was the Buttercup Family. </p>
        <p>"Is there a father?" asked one, "and a mother?" asked another.</p>
        <p>"Yes, indeed; there must be a father and mother if there are to be any seeds," was
            the reply. .</p>
        <p>Then they were told that all forms of plant life have but one object and that object is
            to reproduce their kind --"to make more flowers." </p>
        <p>They were told that the flowers have reproductive organs--"parts that make
                more flowers"--called pistils and stamen.</p>
        <p>The pistils we called the "mothers" because at the bottom of the
            thin tube are the ovules or seeds. The pistils were examined carefully and the very top
            or stamen was found to be very sticky. "Why?" asked the children. But they were
            told they must wait and find out about the father before they found out why the mother
            was sticky.</p>
        <p>Now attention was again called to the seeds lying within the pistil of mother, and the
            fact that they were not developed yet. "Why?" Again we must wait to learn
            something about the father.</p>
        <p>Now we come to the stamen, or "father." This is a slender
            thread-like fiber which has at its end a little case or sac which contains a very fine
            powder-like substance, called the pollen.</p>
        <p>In most of the flowers there are several stamen and one pistil; but in the buttercup,
            there were several of each - so that the Buttercup House contained several families, the
            children were told.</p>
        <p>Now to come back to the fathers, or stamens, and the tiny sacs containing the pollen.
            This pollen is a very important part of the growing of all flowers. The children were
            asked to name some of the flowers which they knew that had this powder on them. Answer
            came in the name of golden rod, wild rose, cherry blossom and many others.</p>
        <p>Now it was explained that this pollen from the stamen, or father, must get into the
            pistil or mother, and reach the ovules or seeds, or the seeds cannot grow and develop
            into new plants. And as this process of developing the seed is the one object of plant
            life, we must see how they go about accomplishing this object. </p>
        <p>This we shall do next week.</p>
