    <headNote resp="MSPP"><p>Margaret Sanger published this short note beneath a letter to the
            editor written by "<person reg="Unidentified">M. B. H.</person>" asking "Don't you think
            you over emphasize the woman's side of the problem to the exclusion of the man's?. . .
            .Shouldn't the instruction in the methods of Birth control be given to men and more
            stress laid upon appealing to them to take this responsibility?"</p>
        <p>For Sanger's published views, see "<xref from="226268.xml">A Parents' Problem or Women's?," Mar. 1919.</xref></p>

        <p>We publish this letter from "M. B. H." because it raises a question bearing immediately
            upon the direction which the Birth Control movement is to take.</p>
        <p>We are well aware that there is a wide difference of opinion upon this matter. My own
            convictions are very decided. I would like before expressing them, however, to give an
            opportunity to others who may have something to say on the subject.</p>
        <p>We will, therefore, devote a page of the next issue of <title type="journal">The Birth
                Control Review</title> to this discussion. Please make your letters as short as
            possible, so that everyone may have a hearing. In the issue following the publication of
            the letters, I hope to state my own views.</p>
