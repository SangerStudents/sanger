        <p>A naturalization class will be held the second and fourth Thursday of each month,
            beginning in December, at 1461 Third Avenue, in the <org>Yorkville Forum</org>. <org
                reg="Socialist Party of New York">Branch 6</org> has been kind enough to give these
            two evenings of each month to the women and men who wish to become naturalized.</p>
        <p>This is your opportunity, women Comrades. It is free to you and everyone is welcome.
            Begin at once to become a citizen, so when you have the suffrage you can use it and not
            have to wait from three to five years to become naturalized.</p>
