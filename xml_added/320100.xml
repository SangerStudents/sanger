        <head>BRANCH 5 WOMEN TO MEET.</head>
        <p>There will be a business meeting of the women of <org
                reg="Socialist Party of New York City">Branch 5</org> on Wednesday, December 13, at
            8 p.m., in the <org>Harlem Forum</org>, 360 West 125th Street. All women Comrades who
            have had lists of the Socialist men Comrades, and the enrolled voters, to call on them
            and interest the wives and women of the family, will please attend this meeting and
            report of the results you have had. If you have not seen all on your list try to do so
            before Wednesday, so that you can take up other work.</p>
        <p>The work is to be divided into districts with a woman organizer to every assembly
            district, who will subdivide the work into election districts. In this way the whole
            territory of the branch can be covered, and with a woman organizer of the branch the
            work can be carried on in conjunction with the general work of the branch in a
            systematic way.</p>
