        <p>In our campaign for voluntary motherhood, three great tasks confront us. These tasks are
            closely coordinated and interrelated. Yet each has its own distinct purpose and method.
            Let us not confuse them. Let us not make the mistake of acting upon the assumption that
            any one of them is enough. Let us not delude ourselves into the belief that our work
            will end when we have successfully solved one of these problems. Let us not depreciate
            efforts in one direction to emphasize work in another. The first essential for
            progressive work is to clear up this confusion. The best way is to make a definite
            statement of these three great tasks. These, it seems to me, are roughly to be
            differentiated as follows:</p>
        <p>(1) AGITATION AND EDUCATION: aiming to arrest, awaken and focus public interest to the
            pivotal importance of birth control; to point out the importance of a sound population
            policy for the <place>United States</place> and all countries of the world; to show the
            organized relationship of the function of Voluntary Motherhood in all programs aiming at
            social advance; to organize enlightened public opinion into decisive action.</p>
        <p>(2) POLITICAL AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION: aiming to effect changes in federal and state laws
            restricting the knowledge and practice of birth control; to the end that hindrances may
            be removed preventing practical education in sex and social hygiene.</p>
        <p>(3) PRACTICAL SCIENTIFIC TEACHING: aiming to meet the demand for birth control and
            hygienic knowledge by women WHO MOST NEED IT; aiming to establish birth control as a
            universal practice.</p>

        <p>IMPORTANT AS are the first two tasks here defined, they are misdirected unless they
            converge towards the third; unless they aim always to facilitate the solution of the
            last and greatest of our problems. We must keep this always in mind. We must work
            realistically. We must begin here and now. We must work from within, out. If birth
            control were not the answer to the immediate needs of submerged and overburdened mothers
            all around us, it would not and could not exhibit such tremendous vitality. From the
            economic, the intellectual, the logical point of view, it might be overwhelmingly
            necessary and convincing; yet if, like so many reform policies, it had to be imposed
            from above-- had in short to be thrust upon the underlying population from above, it
            would be inevitably foredoomed to failure. But it is because birth control is the answer
            to great human needs and the inarticulate cry for help from enslaved women, that it
            cannot be refuted or dismissed.</p>
        <p>If at any moment we lose sight of the struggling, suffering, submerged woman, our work
            will at once become futile and misguided. Visions and dreams of a happy and healthy
            humanity are always inspiring; but too often they act as opiates which close our eyes to
            the cruel facts of life that painfully thrust themselves before our eyes. In our
            intoxication we are apt to place all our faith in some “political or legislative magic
            lamp” which we need merely to rub to effect a glorious transformation. The painful truth
            is this: educational and effective for the women who, from the personal and solve this
            problem: how to make birth control practical and effective for the women who, from the
            personal and racial point of view, most need it.</p>

        <p>The greatest misunderstanding seems to arise, at the present moment, because of our
            support of the movement to effect the amendment of the <place>New York</place> State
            statues (<name type="law" reg="New York State Criminal Code, Section 1145">Article 106,
                Section 1145</name>) aiming thus to clear the way for practical and effective birth
            control education in this state, by removing the present prohibitions to doctors,
            nurses, midwives, clinics and dispensaries. To the objection that this perpetuates and
            even strengthens the so-called “medical monopoly,” let us repeat that this question must
            be practical, effective, and scientific. It cannot be a subject of back-fence gossip. To
            speak of “medical monopoly” is to speak of the monopoly of any specialist in technical
            scientific method and knowledge. We might as well condemn the “dentist’s monopoly,” the
            “occultist’s monopoly,” or the “plumber’s monopoly.” For the best care of our teeth, we
            must go to the dentist, even though we might get much information out of a volume
            devoted to the relation of teeth to health. The proposed state amendment would open a
            direct avenue of approach to the women who need direct education and instruction in
            methods of birth control. It would permit us to get int ouch with these women without
            condescension, but with respect and reverence. Many cannot read-- a pamphlet or book no
            matter how simple or lucid would be valueless. The great point to remember is that we
            must reach each individual woman, because the instruction must be based on individual
            needs and physiological peculiarities, upon individual diagnosis and characteristics,
            which, as any trained investigator knows, very widely. And it is precisely the abnormal
            and submerged woman it is most important to meet.</p>

        <p>In contrast to the state legislation is the proposed repeal of the federal law, aiming to
            open the United States mails to the distribution of birth control knowledge by
            amateurs.</p>
        <p>We must not delude ourselves into the belief that this repeal would automatically cancel
            state laws. It merely opens the mails. It stresses the value of pamphlets and books and
            “literary” information. Even with this repeal, the physician, the nurse or the midwife
            in many of our most thickly populated states would be prevented from giving practical
            oral instruction. We base this opinion on the best legal advice available. We are told
            that the repeal of the federal law would be the quickest and shortest way to achieve our
            goal. But there is no such royal road! We might flood the country with tons of good
            books and pamphlets on the subject by recognized authorities on hygiene, psychology and
            sociology, but with no appreciable effect. (A poor woman once said to me: “<q who="UNK"
                >I have read your book from cover to cover; and yet I am pregnant again!</q>”) To
            offer a pamphlet to a woman who cannot read or is too tired and weary to understand its
            directions, is like offering a printed bill-of-fare to a starving man.</p>
        <p>Yet the repeal of the federal law, would accomplish practically no more than this.
            Nevertheless, to some it seems of primary importance, and those who think so are best
            qualified to throw their energies into that work. There is work for all of us, and it is
            a merely verbal quibble to derogate any phase of our tremendous tasks. Our work requires
            the maximum of patience, persistence, and foresight. The obstacles are great-- much
            greater than some of us suspect. To overcome them we must mobilize all our energy,
            courage and bravery.</p>
        <p>Much as we wish that one fine gesture would sweep aside these obsolete and ridiculous
            anti-contraceptive laws, both federal and state, experience has shown us the emptiness
            of legal and legislative victories unless followed up vigorously by concerted action.
            Remember that in <place>England</place> there is no law preventing the spread of birth
            control knowledge; yet we see there, that the removal of legal restriction in the use of
            the mails is not enough. Our interest and our activity must be positive, fundamental,
            dynamic, constructive. Let us beware of the futility of striving after vain victories
            and theoretical triumphs-- which may, indeed, stimulate in us a fine glow of egotistical
            satisfaction, but also divert and distract our attention and interest from the hard,
            thankless, detailed work of helping overburdened mothers. Let us not be led into the
            trap of believing that the mere repeal of a federal law will change the course of
            ancient human habits or the most deep-rooted of instincts.</p>

        <p>The Amendment to the New York law had the great value of emphasizing the difficulties we
            must inevitably face, instead of blinding us to them. It opens the way to--</p>
        <p>Direct contact between those competent to teach scientific practical birth control and
            sex hygiene to women who need and demand it. Physicians, nurses and midwives in public
            and private practice.</p>
        <p>Establishment of special clinics, dispensaries and hygiene centers.</p>
        <p>Transference of the idea of birth control from the realm of the theoretical, the
            controversial, and the illegal to the field of the experimental, the practical, the
            scientific, the hygiene and the eugenic.</p>
        <p>This means the next and by far the most important step in our work. It is likewise our
            greatest and our central task. To those who spurn such a step, who prefer to place all
            their hopes and all their faith in one only of these great tasks-- the repeal of one
            federal law-- our efforts will undoubtedly seem to prosaic, too lacking in all the flame
            and fire of the newly awakened enthusiast, too much a step-by-step procedure. But let us
            point out again, let us repeat with all the vehemence and emphasis we are capable of; we
            cannot solve our problem, unless we are conscious of, and familiar with the elements and
            factors comprising it.</p>
        <p>When we recognize the threefold character of our work, when we honestly face the many
            obstacles to be overcome, when we come to a realization of the ever harder work ahead of
            us, above all, when we give up the childish idea that we need to see the results of our
            toil or claim a reward for our efforts, we shall find our strength and our energies
            released for work that is its own justification and its own reward.</p>
