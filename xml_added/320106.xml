        <p>In our campaign for voluntary motherhood, three great tasks confront
            us. These tasks are closely coordinated and interrelated. Yet each
            has its own distinct purpose and method. Let us not confuse them.
            Let us not make the mistake of acting upon the assumption that any
            one of them is enough. Let us not delude ourselves into the belief
            that our work will end when we have successfully solved one of these
            problems. Let us not depreciate efforts in one direction to
            emphasize work in another. The first essential for progressive work
            is to clear up this confusion. The best way is to make a definite
            statement of these three great tasks. These, it seems to me, are
            roughly to be differentiated as follows:</p>
        <p>(1) AGITATION AND EDUCATION: aiming to arrest, awaken and focus
            public interest to the pivotal importance of birth control; to point
            out the importance of a sound population policy for the
                <place>United States</place> and all countries of the world; to
            show the organized relationship of the function of Voluntary
            Motherhood in all programs aiming at social advance; to organize
            enlightened public opinion into decisive action.</p>
        <p>(2) POLITICAL AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION: aiming to effect changes in
            federal and state laws restricting the knowledge and practice of
            birth control; to the end that hindrances may be removed preventing
            practical education in sex and social hygiene.</p>
        <p>(3) PRACTICAL SCIENTIFIC TEACHING: aiming to meet the demand for
            birth control and hygienic knowledge by women WHO MOST NEED IT;
            aiming to establish birth control as a universal practice.</p>

        <p>IMPORTANT AS are the first two tasks here defined, they are
            misdirected unless they converge towards the third; unless they aim
            always to facilitate the solution of the last and greatest of our
            problems. We must keep this always in mind. We must work
            realistically. We must begin here and now. We must work from within,
            out. If birth control were not the answer to the immediate needs of
            submerged and overburdened mothers all around us, it would not and
            could not exhibit such tremendous vitality. From the economic, the
            intellectual, the logical point of view, it might be overwhelmingly
            necessary and convincing; yet if, like so many reform policies, it
            had to be imposed from above-- had in short to be thrust upon the
            underlying population from above, it would be inevitably foredoomed
            to failure. But it is because birth control is the answer to great
            human needs and the inarticulate cry for help from enslaved women,
            that it cannot be refuted or dismissed.</p>
        <p>If at any moment we lose sight of the struggling, suffering,
            submerged woman, our work will at once become futile and misguided.
            Visions and dreams of a happy and healthy humanity are always
            inspiring; but too often they act as opiates which close our eyes to
            the cruel facts of life that painfully thrust themselves before our
            eyes. In our intoxication we are apt to place all our faith in some
            “political or legislative magic lamp” which we need merely to rub to
            effect a glorious transformation. The painful truth is this:
            educational and effective for the women who, from the personal and
            solve this problem: how to make birth control practical and
            effective for the women who, from the personal and racial point of
            view, most need it.</p>

        <p>The greatest misunderstanding seems to arise, at the present moment,
            because of our support of the movement to effect the amendment of
            the <place>New York State</place> statues (<name type="law"
                reg="NY State Criminal Code, Section 1145, Article 106">Article
                106, Section 1145</name>) aiming thus to clear the way for
            practical and effective birth control education in this state, by
            removing the present prohibitions to doctors, nurses, midwives,
            clinics and dispensaries. To the objection that this perpetuates and
            even strengthens the so-called “medical monopoly,” let us repeat
            that this question must be practical, effective, and scientific. It
            cannot be a subject of back-fence gossip. To speak of “medical
            monopoly” is to speak of the monopoly of any specialist in technical
            scientific method and knowledge. We might as well condemn the
            “dentist’s monopoly,” the “occultist’s monopoly,” or the “plumber’s
            monopoly.” For the best care of our teeth, we must go to the
            dentist, even though we might get much information out of a volume
            devoted to the relation of teeth to health. The proposed state
            amendment would open a direct avenue of approach to the women who
            need direct education and instruction in methods of birth control.
            It would permit us to get int ouch with these women without
            condescension, but with respect and reverence. Many cannot read-- a
            pamphlet or book no matter how simple or lucid would be valueless.
            The great point to remember is that we must reach each individual
            woman, because the instruction must be based on individual needs and
            physiological peculiarities, upon individual diagnosis and
            characteristics, which, as any trained investigator knows, very
            widely. And it is precisely the abnormal and submerged woman it is
            most important to meet.</p>

        <p>In contrast to the state legislation is the proposed repeal of the
            federal law, aiming to open the United States mails to the
            distribution of birth control knowledge by amateurs.</p>
        <p>We must not delude ourselves into the belief that this repeal would
            automatically cancel state laws. It merely opens the mails. It
            stresses the value of pamphlets and books and “literary”
            information. Even with this repeal, the physician, the nurse or the
            midwife in many of our most thickly populated states would be
            prevented from giving practical oral instruction. We base this
            opinion on the best legal advice available. We are told that the
            repeal of the federal law would be the quickest and shortest way to
            achieve our goal. But there is no such royal road! We might flood
            the country with tons of good books and pamphlets on the subject by
            recognized authorities on hygiene, psychology and sociology, but
            with no appreciable effect. (A poor woman once said to me: “<q
                who="UNK">I have read your book from cover to cover; and yet I
                am pregnant again!</q>”) To offer a pamphlet to a woman who
            cannot read or is too tired and weary to understand its directions,
            is like offering a printed bill-of-fare to a starving man.</p>
        <p>Yet the repeal of the federal law, would accomplish practically no
            more than this. Nevertheless, to some it seems of primary
            importance, and those who think so are best qualified to throw their
            energies into that work. There is work for all of us, and it is a
            merely verbal quibble to derogate any phase of our tremendous tasks.
            Our work requires the maximum of patience, persistence, and
            foresight. The obstacles are great-- much greater than some of us
            suspect. To overcome them we must mobilize all our energy, courage
            and bravery.</p>
        <p>Much as we wish that one fine gesture would sweep aside these
            obsolete and ridiculous anti-contraceptive laws, both federal and
            state, experience has shown us the emptiness of legal and
            legislative victories unless followed up vigorously by concerted
            action. Remember that in <place>England</place> there is no law
            preventing the spread of birth control knowledge; yet we see there,
            that the removal of legal restriction in the use of the mails is not
            enough. Our interest and our activity must be positive, fundamental,
            dynamic, constructive. Let us beware of the futility of striving
            after vain victories and theoretical triumphs-- which may, indeed,
            stimulate in us a fine glow of egotistical satisfaction, but also
            divert and distract our attention and interest from the hard,
            thankless, detailed work of helping overburdened mothers. Let us not
            be led into the trap of believing that the mere repeal of a federal
            law will change the course of ancient human habits or the most
            deep-rooted of instincts.</p>

        <p>The Amendment to the New York law had the great value of emphasizing
            the difficulties we must inevitably face, instead of blinding us to
            them. It opens the way to--</p>
        <p>Direct contact between those competent to teach scientific practical
            birth control and sex hygiene to women who need and demand it.
            Physicians, nurses and midwives in public and private practice.</p>
        <p>Establishment of special clinics, dispensaries and hygiene
            centers.</p>
        <p>Transference of the idea of birth control from the realm of the
            theoretical, the controversial, and the illegal to the field of the
            experimental, the practical, the scientific, the hygiene and the
            eugenic.</p>
        <p>This means the next and by far the most important step in our work.
            It is likewise our greatest and our central task. To those who spurn
            such a step, who prefer to place all their hopes and all their faith
            in one only of these great tasks-- the repeal of one federal law--
            our efforts will undoubtedly seem to prosaic, too lacking in all the
            flame and fire of the newly awakened enthusiast, too much a
            step-by-step procedure. But let us point out again, let us repeat
            with all the vehemence and emphasis we are capable of; we cannot
            solve our problem, unless we are conscious of, and familiar with the
            elements and factors comprising it.</p>
        <p>When we recognize the threefold character of our work, when we
            honestly face the many obstacles to be overcome, when we come to a
            realization of the ever harder work ahead of us, above all, when we
            give up the childish idea that we need to see the results of our
            toil or claim a reward for our efforts, we shall find our strength
            and our energies released for work that is its own justification and
            its own reward.</p>
