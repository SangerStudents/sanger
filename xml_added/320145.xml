        <div>
            <p><q who="CONEA"><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, the elderly
                    battle-axe of planned parenthood--better known as birth control--has sound and
                    emancipated views of the Negro-white situation.</q></p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">I interviewed the 58-year-old, gray-haired, lively woman, with the
                    lined face and eager interest in things, in the offices of the <org>Planned
                        Parenthood Federation of America</org> here.</q></p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">In recent years Miss Sanger has let down from the great energies she
                    gave to her idea in an earlier period. She estimates that she has made about
                    67,000 speeches for birth control--addresses all over <place>America</place>, in
                        <place>Europe</place> and the <place reg="Asia">Orient</place>. It was
                    nothing to speak five or ten times a day.</q></p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">Her home is in <place reg="Tucson, AZ">Tucson, Ariz</place>., now,
                    where she is more or less in retirement, and where she awaits the return from
                    the armed service of her two doctor <person reg="Sanger, Stuart">
                        <person reg="Sanger, Grant">sons</person></person>. But she was in New York
                    long enough to see <person reg="Buck, Pearl">Pearl Buck</person>, Mrs. <person
                        reg="Roosevelt, Eleanor">Eleanor Roosevelt</person> and other women who have
                    supported her in her fight for planned home life, and I managed to get an hour
                    with her.</q></p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <head type="sub">Called “Fanatic”</head>
            <p><q who="CONEA">“Say, Miss Sanger,” I asked “what was the magazine that once referred
                    to you as a fanatic? Was it the <title type="journal">Nation</title> or the
                        <title type="journal">New Republic</title>?”</q></p>
            <p>“I am afraid it was every magazine in the country,” she replied with a smile.</p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">Seated opposite me, in a small office of the federation, Miss Sanger
                    seemed like the most unprepossessing of individuals. She wore a plain, blue
                    cotton dress, a simple blue hat, and a wrist watch that she looked at once or
                    twice.</q></p>
            <p>"<q who="CONEA">How many times did you go to jail, Mrs. Sanger?</q>"</p>
            <p>“Eight times,” <q who="CONEA">she answered</q> “Never for long. It always gave me a
                much-needed rest, however.”</p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">Like <person reg="Anthony, Susan B.">Susan Anthony</person> who fought
                    for woman suffrage, <person reg="Tubman, Harriet">Harriet Tubman</person> who
                    battled for the abolition of chattel slavery, and <person reg="Nation, Carrie"
                        >Carrie Nation</person> who carried the torch for prohibition, Miss Sanger
                    belongs to a small and unique line of American women pioneers.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">Views on Negro</head>
            <p><q who="CONEA">When, before World War I, Miss Sanger launched her famous idea of
                    curtailing the size of families in order to safeguard mothers and children
                    against poverty, disease, crime and miserable home life, she was attacked by
                    “respectable” society. She was insulted, stoned, jailed--but she went on with
                    her work until her idea is a widely-accepted institution in America and in other
                    parts of the world.</q></p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">Miss Sanger views the problems of the American Negro as part of a
                    world problem.</q></p>
            <p>“They are not separate problems,” <q who="CONEA">she says.</q> “It is not just a
                Negro problem. Like the problems of the people of <place>India</place>, of
                minorities everywhere, it is a democratic problem. We have got to work all together
                on these issues.”</p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">She likened the attitude of most of the white North toward the Negro
                    to that of the British attitude toward the Indian peoples. “I like to think of
                    it that way; as a concept of superiority over others.</q>”</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">White Man’s Power</head>
            <p>“I’ve traveled in India and <place>China</place>,” <q who="CONEA">she said.</q>
                “Knowing our own problem, it gave me greater sympathy with the others, with what I
                saw in the Orient. I can recall many horrible things I saw in India. I once saw a
                white man come out of a train; there were five or six Indians in his way; he just
                kicked them away--literally, with his foot. There were a hundred people around, who
                were powerless to strike him. The white man’s power and the Indian’s defenselessness
                were so unjust.</p>
            <p>“In <place>China</place>, the Chinese could not go on ‘our’ property. A Chinese
                doctor was not allowed to see me, couldn’t come into the American area.
                Discrimination is a world-wide thing. It has to be opposed everywhere. That is why I
                feel the Negro’s plight here is linked with that of the oppressed around the
                globe.</p>
            <p>“The big answer, as I see it, is the education of the white man. The white man is the
                problem. It is the same as with the <org
                    reg="National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi)">Nazis.</org> We must
                change the white attitudes. That is where it lies.”</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">Change for Better</head>
            <p><q who="CONEA">I asked Miss Sanger how she had encountered the Negro question in her
                    own special sphere.</q></p>
            <p>“From the very beginning of birth control, there was the problem of approaching the
                Negro. Soon after I launched the campaign, a Harlem
                <person reg="Unknown">Methodist leader</person>, who was most intelligent,
                questioned me about birth control. He was a brilliant speaker, and he had been
                thinking about it. Later a man named <person reg="Harrison, Hubert"
                    >Harrison</person> of the <org reg="Urban League, New York City">Urban
                    League</org> took up our idea.”</p>
            <p>“<q who="CONEA">Have you seen any change in the Negro-white situation generally since
                    the times of your pioneer days?” I wanted to know.</q></p>
            <p>“I think things have changed for the better. There is a changed attitude among
                employers, I believe.”</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">Offered Bribe</head>
            <p>“The Negro has made great progress. Harlem is an example. When we started out in
                Harlem with birth control, we couldn’t get a colored physician. Now there is much
                less of a problem in reaching Harlem physicians with planned parenthood. I think
                this shows how things have advanced.</p>
            <p>“Here is another example of how attitudes have changed. When we first started out an
                    <person reg="Unknown">anti-Negro white man</person> offered me $10,000 if I
                started in Harlem first. His idea was simply to cut down the number of Negroes. ‘<q
                    who="UNK">Spread it as far as you can among them,</q>’ he said. That is, of
                course, not our idea. I turned him down. But that is an example of how vicious some
                people can be about this thing.</p>
            <p>“It is our experience, as it was our aim, that as a result of child-spacing and
                adequate care of mothers, death rates would be reduced. It is now a fact that as a
                result of birth control, the survival rate among mothers and children is higher.
                There is less sufferings for all groups.”</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">Tells of Tucson</head>
            <p><q who="CONEA">Miss Sanger based her views of the general situation on her own broad
                    experience and travel. She spoke of Tucson, Ariz.</q></p>
            <p>“It is not so bad there,”<q who="CONEA"> she said. </q>“There is no Jim Crow in the
                theatres, and the restaurants serve Negroes equally with whites. But there is some
                overflow of southern idea into the state and supremacist feeling can be found
                there.”</p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">I asked her to recall some experience from her own travel in the
                    South.</q></p>
            <p>“Yes,” <q who="CONEA">she said, </q>“I remember addressing a colored church group
                once. I was staying with a <person reg="Unknown">white doctor</person> at the time.
                They didn’t let a Negro doctor introduce me to the people. The white doctor had to
                do it. That was in <place reg="Memphis, TN">Memphis</place>.”</p>
            <p>“What hangs over the South is that the Negro has been in servitude. The white
                southerner is slow to forget this. His attitude is the archaic in this age.
                Supremacist thinking belongs in the museum.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">Breaking Barriers</head>
            <p>“One thing that is most helpful is to have people working together. When you have
                Negroes working with whites you have the breakdown of barriers, the beginning of
                progress. Negro groups must take the initiative, and not wait around for integration
                to come to them. They must get it themselves. The struggle for it will bring
                it.”</p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">I thought that she had spoken well enough and broadly enough on the
                    general situation and then asked her about planned parenthood--for Miss Sanger
                    has more to give the Negro than ideas; she has the gift of her own famous
                    plan.</q></p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">“What can the Negro group do in connection with planned parenthood?” I
                    asked.</q></p>
            <p>“In the first place, the Negro leaders should understand it. It is a basic principle
                for a sound healthy race. Leaders should have the courage in their respective
                communities to stand for the idea. Planned parenthood is not aimed at any one
                people. It is for all, and the objective is to do away with the waste of life</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">Cites Death Rate</head>
            <p>“A sickly race is a weak race. As long as Negro mothers die in childbirth at two and
                one-half times the rate of white mothers, as long as Negro babies are dying at twice
                the rate of white babies, colored homes will be unhappy.</p>
            <p>“Greater understanding and practice of planned parenthood, through the use of
                contraceptive methods prescribed by doctors and clinics, will mean that there will
                be more strong and healthy children and fewer defective and handicapped babies
                unable to find a useful or happy place in life.</p>
            <p>“Planned parenthood does not mean using contraceptives not to have babies. It means
                using medically prescribed methods so that each member of the family will come into
                life in good health and wanted by its parents.</p>
            <p>“Years ago the first emphasis of birth control was on family limitation and it still
                is in advising those parents to whom another child might mean death of the mother or
                added misery. Since then, however, planned parenthood has shifted its emphasis to
                child-spacing--allowing each mother needed rest and recuperation between each
                birth.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">Aid Childless Couples</head>
            <p>“More recently planned parenthood has come to include treatment of infertility for
                childless couples who want children but have been unable to have them.”</p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">Miss Sanger said that planned parenthood is not “quack medicine,” but
                    a widely-approved measure.</q> “Most doctors now believe in it and it has been
                approved by both the <org>American Medical Association</org> and the <org>National
                    Medical Association</org>,” she pointed out.</p>
            <p><q who="CONEA">In conclusion she said: </q>“The extension of planned parenthood to
                reach millions of colored families now handicapped for lack of this knowledge is not
                a panacea for all the ills of the race.</p>
            <p>“But planned parenthood, together with x-rays for tuberculosis, penicillin for other
                maladies, venereal disease control and other health measures can help the Negro
                family to attain a position of greater strength and security in America.</p>
            <p>“Negro participation in planned parenthood means democratic participation in a
                democratic idea. Like other democratic ideas, planned parenthood places greater
                value on human life and the dignity of each person. Without planning at birth, the
                life of Negroes as a whole in a democratic world cannot be planned.”</p>
