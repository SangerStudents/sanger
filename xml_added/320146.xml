            <head type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>There is no need for any one to explain to the working men and women in <place
                    reg="United States"> America</place> what this pamphlet is written for or why it
                is necessary that they should have this information. They know better than I could
                tell them, so I shall not try.</p>
            <p>I have tried to give the knowledge of the best French and Dutch physicians translated
                into the simplest English, that all may easily understand.</p>
            <p>There are various and numerous mechanical means of prevention which I have not
                mentioned here, mainly because I have not come into personal contact with those who
                have used them or could recommend them as entirely satisfactory.</p>
            <p>I feel there is sufficient information given here, which, if followed, will prevent a
                woman from becoming pregnant unless she desires to do so.</p>
            <p>If a woman is too indolent to wash and cleanse herself, and the man too selfish to
                consider the consequences of the act, then it will be difficult to find a preventive
                to keep the woman from becoming pregnant.</p>
            <p>Of course, it is troublesome to get up to douche, it is also a nuisance to have to
                trouble about the date of the menstrual period. It seems inartistic and sordid to
                insert a pessary or a suppository in anticipation of the sexual act. But it is far
                more sordid to find yourself several years later burdened down with half a dozen
                unwanted children, helpless, starved, shoddily clothed, dragging at your skirt,
                yourself a dragged out shadow of the woman you once were.</p>
            <p>Don't be over sentimental in this important phase of hygiene. The inevitable fact is
                that unless you prevent the male sperm from entering the womb, you are going to
                become pregnant. Women of the working class, especially wage workers, should not
                have more than two children at most. The average working man can support no more and
                the average working woman can take care of no more in decent fashion. It has been my
                experience that more children are not really wanted, but that the women are
                compelled to have them either from lack of foresight or through ignorance of the
                hygiene of preventing conception.</p>
            <p>It is only the workers who are ignorant of the knowledge of how to prevent bringing
                children in the world to fill jails and hospitals, factories and mills, insane
                asylums and premature graves.</p>
            <p>The working women can use direct action by refusing to supply the market with
                children to be exploited, by refusing to populate the earth with slaves.</p>
            <p>It is also the one most direct method for you working women to help yourself <emph
                    rend="italics"> today</emph>.</p>
            <p>Pass on this information to your neighbor and comrade workers. Write out any of the
                following information which you are sure will help her, and pass it along where it
                is needed. Spread this important knowledge!</p>

        <div>
            <head type="sub">A NURSE'S ADVICE TO WOMEN.</head>
            <p>Every woman who is desirous of preventing conception will follow this advice:</p>
            <p>Don't wait to see if you do <emph rend="italics">not</emph> menstruate (monthly
                sickness) but make it your duty to see that you <emph rend="italics"> do.</emph></p>
            <p>If you are due to be "sick" on the eighth of August, do not wait until the eighth to
                see, but begin as early as the fourth to take a good laxative for the bowels, and
                continue this each night until the eighth.</p>
            <p>If there is the slightest possibility that the male fluid has entered the vagina,
                take on these same nights before retiring, five or ten grains of quinine, with a hot
                drink. The quinine in capsule form is considered fresher, but if this is taken do
                not use alcoholic drinks directly after, as it hardens the capsules, thus delaying
                the action of the quinine.</p>
            <p>By taking the above precautions you will prevent the ovum from making its nest in the
                lining of the womb.</p>
            <p>Women of intelligence who refuse to have children until they are ready for them, keep
                definite track of the date of their menstrual periods. A calendar should be kept, on
                which can be marked the date of the last menstruation, as well as the date when the
                next period should occur.</p>
            <p>Women must learn to know their own bodies, and watch and know definitely how regular
                or irregular they are: if the period comes regularly every twenty-eight days
                (normal) or every thirty days as is in the case of many young girls.</p>
            <p>Mark it accordingly on your private calendar; do not leave it to memory or guess
                work.</p>
            <p>Only ignorance and indifference will cause one to be careless in this most important
                matter.</p>
            <p>A very good laxative (though it is a patent medicine) is Beechams Pills. Two of these
                taken night and morning, four days before menstruation, will give a good cleansing
                of the bowels, and assist with the menstrual flow. Castor oil is also a good
                laxative.</p>
            <p>The American physicians may object to this advice because Beechams Pills are a patent
                medicine. But until they are willing to give open advice on this subject, we must
                resort to such as the least harmful, until such time as they do.</p>
            <p>If a woman will give herself attention BEFORE the menstrual period arrives, she will
                almost never have any trouble, but if she neglects herself and waits to see if she
                "comes around," she is likely to have difficulty.</p>
            <p>If the action of quinine has not expelled the semen from the uterus, and a week has
                elapsed with no signs of the menstrual flow, then it is safe to assume conception
                has taken place.</p>
            <p>Any attempt to interfere with the development of the fertilized ovum is called an
                abortion.</p>
            <p>No one can doubt that there are times where an abortion is justifiable but they will
                become <emph rend="italics">unnecessary when care is taken to prevent
                    conception.</emph></p>
            <p>This is the <emph rend="italics"> only</emph> cure for abortions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">NO SAFE PERIOD.</head>
            <p>There is current among people an idea that conception can take place only at certain
                times of the month. For instance: ten days after the menstrual period, and four or
                five days before the next period. This is not to be relied upon at all, for it has
                been proven again and again that some women conceive at any time in the month. Do
                not depend upon this belief, for there is no scientific foundation for it. There is
                also the knowledge that nursing after childbirth prevents the return of the
                menstrual flow for several months and conception does not take place. It is well not
                to depend upon this too much, especially after the fifth month, for often a woman
                becomes pregnant again without having "seen anything" or without her realizing that
                she has become pregnant. She thus finds herself with one at the breast and another
                in the womb. Use some preventive.</p>
            <p>Again, it is believed that conception cannot take place if the woman lies upon her
                left side at the time of the act. It makes no difference which side she lies upon;
                she can become pregnant if the semen is not prevented from entering the womb.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub"><foreign lang="LAT">COITUS INTERRUPTUS</foreign>.</head>
            <p>Perhaps the commonest preventive excepting the use of the condom is "<foreign
                    lang="LAT">coitus interruptus</foreign>," or withdrawal of the penis from the
                vagina shortly before the ejection of the semen. No one can doubt that this is a
                perfectly safe method; and it is not considered so dangerous to the man as some
                authorities have formerly viewed it, but it requires a man of the strongest
                willpower to be certain that he has withdrawn before any of the semen has been
                deposited in the vagina. It is very difficult to determine exactly whether this has
                been done. The greatest objection to this is the evil effect upon the woman's
                nervous condition. If she has not completed her desire, she is under a highly
                nervous tension, her whole being is perhaps on the verge of satisfaction. She is
                then left in this dissatisfied state. This does her injury. A mutual and satisfied
                sexual act is of great benefit to the average woman, the magnetism of it is health
                giving. When it is not desired on the part of the woman and she has no response,
                    <emph rend="italics"> it should not take place</emph>. This is an act of
                prostitution and is degrading to the woman's finer sensibility, all the marriage
                certificates on earth to the contrary notwithstanding. Withdrawal on the part of the
                man should be substituted by some other means that does not injure the woman.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">DOUCHES AND THEIR IMPORTANCE.</head>
            <p>The most important part which every woman should learn in the methods of preventing
                conception, is to cleanse herself thoroughly by means of the vaginal douche.</p>
            <p>If you have bathing conveniences, go as quickly as possible to the bath room after
                the sexual act and prepare a douche. Lie down upon the back in the bath tub. Hang
                the filled douche bag high over the tub; and let the water flow freely into the
                vagina, to wash out the male sperm which was deposited during the act.</p>
            <p>Do not be afraid to assist the cleansing by introducing the first finger with the
                tube and washing out the semen from the folds of the membrane. One can soon learn to
                tell by the feeling when it is sufficiently clean. It is said, that the French women
                are the most thorough douchers in the world, which helps greatly in keeping the
                organs in a clean and healthy condition, as well as preventing the male sperm from
                reaching the womb to mate with the ovum.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">SOLUTIONS FOR DOUCHING.</head>
            <p>When there are no bath room conveniences--a douche can be taken over the toilet or
                when that is impossible it can be taken over a vessel in a squatting position.</p>
            <p>Following are some of the solutions to be used for the douche, which, when carefully
                used will kill the male sperm or prevent its entering the womb:</p>
            <p>Lysol--is a brown oily liquid which added to water forms a clear soapy solution. One
                teaspoonful of lysol to 2 quarts of water (warm) makes a good solution for douching.
                Mix into a pitcher or vessel before placing it in the bag.</p>
            <p>Bichloride--Get the tablets blue or white from the druggist; the blue are less
                dangerous to have about because of the color. Always mix this solution thoroughly in
                a glass or pitcher before turning it into the bag. Never drop the tablet directly
                into the bag. One tablet to two quarts of water makes a sufficiently strong solution
                for preventive purposes.</p>
            <p>Potassium Permanganate--This also makes a good solution, especially where there is a
                vaginal discharge. The special objection to this is that it stains the skin and
                clothing. This can be purchased in crystal form, and one teaspoonful dissolved in
                two quarts of water is the proper strength.</p>
            <p>Salt solution--Mix four tablespoons of table salt in one quart of warm or cold water
                and dissolve thoroughly. This is good and cheap.</p>
            <p>Vinegar solution--Many peasants in <place>Europe</place> use vinegar as an antiseptic
                almost exclusively. One glassful to two quarts of water is the strength usually
                desired. Cider vinegar is preferred. Douche afterward with clear water.</p>
            <p>Cold water douche--This will sometimes remove the semen quite effectively without the
                aid of an antiseptic. But as the semen can hide itself away in the wrinkled lining
                of the vaginal cavity, the cold water will only impede its progress for a time. As
                soon as the warmth of the body revives its activity, the semen continues on its
                journey to meet the ovum.</p>
            <p>Every woman should possess a good two quart rubber douche bag called fountain
                syringe. Hang it high enough to insure a steady direct flow.</p>
            <p>Bulb syringes, such as the whirling spray syringes, have been found satisfactory by
                many women for the purpose of injecting antiseptic solutions. Directions with
                syringe.</p>
            <p>Some women use the douche before the sexual act as a preventive. If this is done, any
                astringent such as boric acid, alum, citric acid, hydrochlorate of quinine used in
                the solution will do. Only a pint of solution is needed for this purpose, following
                the act a larger douche is used as a cleanser. This can also be done with the
                regular antiseptic douche.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">THE USE OF THE CONDOM OR "COTS."</head>
            <p>There is little doubt that a thorough douching of the genital passage with an
                antiseptic solution performed by skilled hands immediately after the sexual act
                would destroy the male sperm, and nothing else would be necessary. But there is
                always the possibility that the sperm has entered the womb before the solution can
                reach it.</p>
            <p>It is safer therefore to prevent the possibility of the contact of the semen and the
                ovum, by the interposition of a wall between them. One of the best is the condom or
                rubber "cot."</p>
            <p>These are made of soft tissues which envelope the male organ (penis) completely and
                serve to catch the semen at the time of the act. In this way the sperm does not
                enter the vagina.</p>
            <p>The condoms are obtainable at all drug stores at various prices. There are some of
                skin gut and some of rubber tissue. These are seamless, thin and elastic and yet
                tough; if properly adjusted will not break. Fear of breaking is the main objection
                to their use. If space has not been allowed for expansion of the penis, at the time
                the semen is expelled, the tissue is likely to split and the sperm finds it way into
                the uterus. The woman becomes pregnant without being conscious of it. If on the
                other hand care is given to the adjustment of the condom, not fitting it too close,
                it will act as one of the best protectors against both conception and venereal
                disease. Care must be exercised in withdrawing the penis after the act, not to allow
                the condom to peel off, thereby allowing the semen to pass into the vagina.</p>
            <p>It is desirable to discard the condom after it has been used once. But as this is not
                always done, care must be taken to wash the condom in an antiseptic solution before
                drying it and placing it away for further use.</p>
            <p>The condom is one of the most commonly known preventives in the United States. It has
                another value quite apart from prevention in decreasing the tendency in the male to
                arrive at the climax in the sexual act before the female.</p>
            <p>There are few men and women so perfectly mated that the climax of the act is reached
                together. It is usual for the male to arrive at this stage earlier than the female,
                with the consequence that he is further incapacitated to satisfy her desire for some
                time after. During this time the woman is in a highly nervous condition, and it is
                the opinion of the best medical authorities that a continuous condition of this
                unsatisfied state brings on or causes disease of her generative organs, besides
                giving her a perfect horror and repulsion for the sexual act.</p>
            <p>Thousands of well meaning men ask the advice of physicians as to the cause of the
                sexual coldness and indifference of their wives. Nine times out of ten it is the
                fault of the man, who through ignorance and selfishness and inconsiderateness, has
                satisfied his own desire and promptly gone off to sleep. The woman in self defense
                has learned to protect herself from the long hours of sleepless nights and nervous
                tension by refusing to become interested.</p>
            <p>The condom will often help in this difficulty. There are many girls who have had no
                education on this subject, no idea of the physiology of the act, who upon any
                contact of the semen have a disgust and repulsion, from which it takes some time to
                recover. Much depends upon the education of the girl, but most depends upon the
                attitude of the man toward the relation.</p>

            <head type="sub">THE PESSARY AND THE SPONGE.</head>
            <p>Another form of prevention is the pessary (see cut). This is one of the most common
                preventive articles used in <place>France</place> as well as among the women of the
                middle and upper class in America. At one time the cost of these ranged up to seven
                dollars, as they were imported into this country from France. Today they are
                manufactured in this country, and may be had from two dollars up.</p>
            <p>They come in three sizes--large, medium and small.</p>
            <p>It is well to get the medium size, as the small ones are only for very small boned
                women and easily get out of place.</p>
            <p>In my estimation a well fitted pessary is one of the surest methods of preventing
                conception. I have known hundreds of women who have used it for years with the most
                satisfactory results. The trouble is women are afraid of their own bodies, and are
                of course ignorant of their physical construction. They are silly in thinking the
                pessary can go up too far, or that it could get lost, etc., etc., and therefore
                discard it. It can not get into the womb, neither can it get lost. The only thing it
                can do is to come out. And even that will give warning by the discomfort of the
                bulky feeling it causes, when it is out of place.</p>
            <p>Before inserting pessary inject into cap a small amount of boric ointment. This will
                act as a cement to help seal the mouth of the womb for the time being and thus
                doubly insures prevention.</p>
            <p>In inserting the pessary it is well to get into a position which will make the
                entrance easy. One foot resting on a low chair opens the parts considerably, also a
                squatting position brings the uterus lower and makes the fitting of the pessary
                easier. Do not use vaseline or oils on rubber, it decays it. Glycerine or soap
                rubbed on its surface makes it smooth enough to slip easily into place.</p>
            <p>After the pessary has been placed into the vagina deeply, it can be fitted well over
                the neck of the womb. One can feel it is fitted by pressing the finger around the
                soft part of the pessary, which should completely cover the mouth of the womb.</p>
            <p>If you do not feel the mouth of the womb through the rubber then the pessary is not
                on right. It should be moved backward a little or forward until the mouth can be
                felt covered. If you still cannot feel it then remove and use some other preventive.
                The uterus may be turned or tipped back so far that a pessary could not reach the
                cervix. </p>
            <p>If it is properly adjusted there will be no discomfort, the man will be unconscious
                that anything is used, and no germ or semen can enter the womb.</p>
            <p>It is not always necessary to take a douche until the following morning, but it is
                always <emph rend="italics">safer</emph> to douche immediately after the act. Take
                part or about a quart of an antiseptic douche BEFORE the pessary is removed; after
                removing it continue the douche and cleanse thoroughly.</p>
            <p>Wash the pessary in clear cold water, dry well and place away in the box. One should
                last two years, if cared for.</p>
            <p>I consider the use of the pessary as one of the most convenient, as well as the
                cheapest and the safest method of prevention. Any nurse or doctor will teach one how
                to adjust it; then women can teach each other.</p>
            <p>It is not advisable to wear the pessary all the time. Take it out after using, and
                wear it only when needed. A little experience will teach one that to place it is a
                simple matter.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">SPONGES.</head>
            <p>Sponges can also be had at the drug store. They have a tape attached to them to be
                conveniently removed. They should be soaked in an antiseptic solution for a few
                minutes before coitus and then introduced into the vagina far up as they can be
                placed. Some physicians have recommended the use of the cotton plug, instead of the
                sponge, to be soaked in a solution of three per cent carbolic and glycerine, before
                the act. The male sperm is destroyed by the weakest solution of carbolic acid. Some
                of the peasants in <place>Europe</place> use the cotton plug soaked in vinegar for
                the same purpose and find it satisfactory. In this country a boric acid solution has
                been used for the same purpose and with satisfactory results. Of course this
                requires a saturated solution, as, for instance, one teaspoonful of the powder to a
                cup of water stirred until dissolved.</p>
            <p>Sponges and plugs can be recommended as perfectly safe, if followed by an antiseptic
                douche before the removal of the plug or sponge, thus preventing the sperm from
                entering the womb. The problem is: to kill the male sperm upon entering the vagina,
                or to wash it out or to kill it directly afterwards. A weak solution of alum may
                also be used for cotton plugs and sponges, <emph rend="italics">also carbolated
                    vaseline on plugs</emph>.</p>
            <p>One of the cheapest methods of birth control is the use of a large sponge.</p>
            <p>Get one fully as large as the fist--boil it for ten minutes. Before using it dip it
                in water and vinegar half and half and squeeze out partly, then push it up as far as
                it will go, pack it tight around the mouth of the womb so that it covers completely.
                Douche thoroughly after its removal.</p>

            <head type="sub">VAGINAL SUPPOSITORIES.</head>
            <p>Suppositories are becoming more generally used in U.S.A. than any other method of
                prevention.</p>
            <p>These may be found at any reliable pharmacy. The majority of them are made from cocoa
                butter or gelatine, which makes it necessary that they be deposited in the vagina
                several minutes before the act, in order for them to melt. Special ingredients
                negate the effect of the male seed.</p>
            <p>Get your druggist to make up any of the following:</p>
            <p>Vaginal Suppository<lb/></p>
            <p rend="blockquote">Acid citric, 6 grains<lb/>Acid boracic, 1 dram<lb/>Cocoa butter, 90
                grains</p>
            <p>Another suppository found reliable is:</p>
            <p rend="blockquotes">Boric acid, 10 grains <lb/>Salicylic acid, 2 grains<lb/>Quinine
                bisulphate, 3 grains<lb/>Cocoa butter, 60 grains</p>
            <p>Practically all vaginal suppositories act as preventives but the following are
                especially recommended.</p>
            <p>The Alotan suppository, obtainable from the <org>Alotan Manufacturing Company</org>,
                153 South Broad Street, <place reg="Nazareth, PA">Nazareth, Pa.</place>, at the rate
                of one dozen for sixty cents and two dozen for one dollar. It is inexpensive and
                highly efficient.</p>
            <p>The Aseptikon suppository, obtainable at most drug stores is also reliable. It is
                however more expensive.</p>
            <p>The Carbozine Tablet, obtainable from The <org>Carbozine Laboratory</org>, 3121 South
                Broadway, <place reg="St. Louis, MO">St. Louis, Mo.</place>, is highly recommended
                by women residing in rural districts as very well suited for their use.</p>
            <p>Practically all vaginal suppositories act as preventives. They should be kept in a
                cool place.</p>
            <p>I have given in the foregoing pages the most commonly known means of prevention.
                Personally I recommend every poor woman to use a well fitted pessary and learn to
                adjust it.</p>
            <p>Birth control, or family limitation, has been recommended by some of the leading
                physicians of the United States and Europe. The movement can no longer be set back
                by setting up the false cry of "obscenity." It has already been
                incorporated into the private moral code of millions of the most influential
                families in every civilized country. It will shortly win full acceptation and
                sanction by public morality as well.</p>
            <p>In cases of women suffering from serious ailments, such as Bright's disease, heart
                disease, insanities, melancholia, idiocy, consumption, and syphilis, all a physician
                is allowed to do is to tide these women through their pregnancies if possible. Even
                though the life of the woman is positively endangered, he cannot relieve her without
                calling a colleague in consultation. Therefore, the mortality of mothers suffering
                from these diseases and their infants is very high, and premature births common.</p>
            <p>To conserve the lives of these mothers and to prevent the birth of diseased or
                defective children are factors emphasizing the crying need of a sound and sane
                educational campaign for birth control.</p>
