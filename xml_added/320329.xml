        <head>MODERN SCHOOLS IN SPAIN.</head>
        <div>
            <p>When the Spanish Government, dominated by the <org>Catholic Church</org>, shot
                    <person reg="Ferrer i Guàrdia, Francesc">Francisco Ferrer</person> in the
                fortress of Montjuich at <place reg="Barcelona, Spain">Barcelona</place> on October
                13th 1909, and contemptuously threw his body into a ditch resembling a rubbish heap,
                it knew well the innocence of the man it had murdered.</p>
            <p>The Spanish people knew that Ferrer was innocent. Ferrer's friends and comrades knew
                that his death was a consequence of a well designed plot by both Church and State,
                and they have not forgotten it.</p>
            <p>The Spanish people do not look upon the Government as a vague, mysterious something
                of which no one can be held responsible, or no one held accountable for its deeds or
                blunders; they look upon those in authority as responsible for the results of their
                authority. They make the responsibility quite definite. They never forget a wrong,
                and usually the responsible party pays the bill.</p>
            <p>The death of Francisco Ferrer has not been forgotten by the Spanish people. The
                memory of it burns in the hearts of his comrades like a cankered wound, and shall
                continue to embitter their lives until those they know responsible for his death
                shall have been called to account.</p>
            <p><place>Spain</place> is one of the last countries to continue in the clutches of the
                    <org reg="Catholic Church">Church of Rome</org>, and even here one can feel the
                ebbing tide of its downfall by the attitude of the people who sneer and joke at the
                priests in passing, to say nothing of the convents and churches burned and
                demolished by the people each time there is an uprising.</p>
            <p>The first awakening and forward step of Spain will be to drive the priests out of the
                country as was done in <place>France</place> only a few years ago, and the Catholic
                Church realizes that day is not far distant.</p>
            <p>In all modern countries the superstition inculcated by the teaching of the Church has
                had to give way before the facts of natural science and evolution. The church in
                Spain knows it, and seeing that the <org>Modern School</org> was to advance these
                teachings, not only to the adult but to the child, it furiously began preparations
                to annihilate the idea, as well as to assassinate its advocate.</p>
            <p>The teachings of freedom, truth and reason, based on science undermines the very
                structures of the church; consequently they shall not be taught if the powers that
                rule can prevent it. Thus it was that the Modern School was doomed in Spain, and its
                founder and advocate, Francisco Ferrer, sentenced and shot to death, with "<q
                    who="FERFR">Long Live the Modern School</q>" as the last words from his
                lips.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">SPAIN AND SPANISH CHARACTER.</head>
            <p>To know something of the Modern Schools in Spain as they are to-day, it is necessary
                to know something of Spanish life and Spanish character, but especially is it
                essential to know the conditions existing there, as well as those under which the
                schools are conducted and continued.</p>
            <p>It has been difficult to obtain any exact information concerning the Schools in Spain
                for that reason. So many explanations must accompany the facts that one must see or
                know the bulwark of ignorance, prejudice, poverty, existing there, before we can
                realize the task of the Modern School, as well as realize the vision, courage and
                idealism which must have prompted Ferrer to establish the Modern School in
                Spain.</p>
            <p>In <place reg="United States">America</place> the average child attending public
                school has included in his educational studies music and art, while in Spain the
                average child is considered very fortunate indeed if it has the opportunity to learn
                to read and write. If one can keep this fact alone in mind, it will help us to
                understand how very difficult and ponderous is the work of pushing an advanced line
                of education when the first essentials of all education are looked upon as a
                luxury.</p>
            <p>However, I believe that to Ferrer this might not have been an obstacle, but rather an
                advantage, and I feel more convinced than ever, after a two-months' visit to
                Barcelona and coming in constant contact with his closest friends and comrades, that
                Ferrer had hopes of realizing his ideal quicker through the teachings of the Modern
                School in Spain than elsewhere, mainly because of the strong individualism in the
                Spanish character.</p>
            <p>Spain is a gaunt, denuded, tragic country, with vast desolated steppes and red
                impoverished soil which gives one the feeling that it has been soaked in human blood
                for centuries. And perhaps it has, for anyone who knows the history of that at one
                time strongest and most powerful country in the world, knows that the spilling of
                blood was of a very little concern for centuries back.</p>
            <p>Many Spaniards count the downfall of Spain from the date when the Jews were driven
                from its land in the sixteenth century, for with the Jews went the greatest force
                for commercial initiative, a quality, fortunately or unfortunately, greatly lacking
                in Spain to-day. Others think that an important cause of its downfall came from all
                classes thinking the same way, and advocate opposition and strugle as essential to
                vigor and growth.</p>
            <p>Whatever the cause of its downfall in the past matters little, but the fact is that
                to-day the Church of Rome has the Spanish Government by the throat and both together
                in harness have killed the peoples' faith in government, as well as crushed all
                public initiative, which a people so naturally individual might have. The Spanish
                are a people born for action and passionate deeds, but these two vipers have
                continually cramped their development, while it held them in its toils.</p>
            <p>In many respects Spain has changed little since the sixteenth century. There are
                to-day five thousand villages and towns which can only be reached by bridle paths.
                Donkeys are used for transportation in parts even where the roads are good, and it
                is the quaintest sight to one coming from a land of subways and elevated electric
                railways to watch the donkey with the pack on its back, which consists of
                vegetables, eggs, butter, etc., and the owner, woman or man, walking beside it,
                saunter leisurely up and down these winding roads, master of at least himself, if
                not the donkey. It is the northern part of Spain that is, commercially speaking, the
                most progressive. Barcelona is the main and largest city.</p>
            <p><place reg="Catalonia, Spain">Catalonia</place> is the largest part of the north, and
                the Catalan is the progressive and industrial force of all Spain, without which
                Spain would be little. Consequently, Barcelona is the main industrial centre, and
                you are warned that it is one of the most dangerous and lawless cities in
                    <place>Europe</place>, where thousands of anarchists gather and plot and where
                bomb-throwing has become an art.</p>
            <p>It is not only the people of Barcelona who are lawless, for in a certain sense the
                whole Spanish people are; they are very hostile to rulers and government, for every
                child knows the evils of "El Caciqusmo" (Tammany Hall), and by nature they are a
                nation of individuals. Each is a law unto himself, whose chief qualities are
                independence and personal dignity.</p>
            <p>As capitalism has never strongly got a footing there, the Spanish nature, as yet, has
                not been turned into a machine-made product for its use. They despise routine and
                toil, and simply won't get into its meshes if they can avoid it.</p>
            <p>A story is told of the Spaniard going to "<q who="UNK">seek his fortune</q>" in
                    <place>South America</place>, who, after finding a position to his satisfaction,
                worked three hours and then asked for his pay. He was refused, and immediately
                walked off. When asked by the employer the the cause of his departure, he exclaimed
                in anger: "<q who="UNK">Do you think I'm going to work for you all my life!</q>"</p>
            <p>Another is related of an American business man, who, while travelling through Spain,
                saw a fine business for himself if he could purchase some of the lovely baskets so
                commonly used there. He went to a man who sold them and tried to give an order for a
                half-million, but the size of the order disgusted the the Spaniard who refused to
                accept it. A large order could not interest him, it seemed impossible to fulfill it.
                There are so many interesting characteristics about the Spanish people that it is
                difficult to stop when one begins, but one cannot over-emphasize their hatred of
                government.</p>
            <p>One well known Spaniard has said of Spain: "<q who="UNK">Democracy, Republicanism or
                    Socialism has in reality little to do in our country, for we do not willingly
                    accept either king, president, priest or prophet</q>." And not only against
                authority but also against all drudgery does the Spanish temperament rebel: he has
                little persistence in his nature, but acts mainly on impulse. He has the qualities
                which <person reg="France, Anatole">Anatole France</person> ascribes to men of
                action. He would have no system of government at all if it were possible, for his
                nature is restive and tumultuous under restraint.</p>
            <p>He knows, too, how to use freedom without abuse, as one can see in hundreds of
                instances in his daily life. For instance, the waiter at the hotel where I lived in
                Barcelona calmly left the dining-room and went down the street for a shave while we
                were having our soup! He returned quite in time to serve the following course, happy
                and clean, while no one seemed even conscious of his absence. A waiter often stands
                and talks to his guests, listens to their conversations and enters into it quite
                naturally and with as much dignity as if he were sitting and being served instead of
                serving. No one seems surprised at this, which in any other country would be
                resented as insolence. Instead, there is every courtesy and respect shown to him
                just as he shows it to others.</p>
            <p>Courtesy, ceremony, dignity is in the marrow of the Spaniards' bones. Even the
                beggars (of which there are thousands) address each other as "<q who="UNK">Lord</q>"
                    (<foreign lang="SPA">Senor</foreign>). "<q who="UNK">Is your lordship a
                    thief</q>?" "<q who="UNK">Yes, to serve God and all good people</q>." And again,
                    "<q who="UNK">Where is your excellency to sleep to-night?</q>" "<q who="UNK"
                    >Under the bridge, my lord.</q>"</p>
            <p>Individual pride and personal respect are dominant notes of Spain, but besides these
                outward qualities there is a natural intelligence dominant in the most ignorant
                person.</p>
