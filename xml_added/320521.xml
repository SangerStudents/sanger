                <p>--Last winter <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> spent ten
                    weeks in <place>India</place>, speaking on birth control to large audiences
                    throughout the country. During her visit she held more than forty public
                    meetings, established about fifty centers of birth control information and
                    secured the endorsements of the <org>All-India Women’s Conference</org>, the
                        <org>All-India Medical Conference</org> and <org
                        reg="Bombay Municipal Corporation">Bombay municipality</org>.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Sanger stayed two days with <person reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K."
                        >Gandhi</person> at his <emph rend="italics">ashrama</emph> in <place
                        reg="Wardha, India">Wardha</place> and engaged him in a friendly argument on
                    birth control. We quote what Mrs. Sanger says in her own diary of their
                    meeting:</p></q>
            <p>“We went directly to his place and met, although this is his day of silence. He rose
                to greet me, smiling from ear to ear. I put down my bag and gloves and flowers and
                magazines inorder to take both his hands. He has an unusual light that shines in his
                face; that shines through the flesh; that circles around his head and neck like a
                mist with white sails of a ship coming through. It lasted only a few seconds, but it
                is there. When I looked again it was only the shiny appearance of his flesh that I
                saw but always the smile and a hospitable welcome.”</p>
            <p><q who="EA">Since Mrs. Sanger arrived on Gandhi’s day <supplied>of</supplied>
                    silence, she spent her first day inspecting the industries connected with the
                    ashrama.</q></p>
            <p><q who="EA">In the evening there was </q>“supper on the veranda at Gandhiji’s
                residence. They are building another story to the old house for his study. Now he
                has no privacy and needs it. We all sat on the floor. Shoes removed first, food is
                placed on trays by attendants. No one may eat until prayers are said which are said
                only when the tray has considerable food. It was a chant by all in a ‘lullaby’ tune.
                Gandhiji gave me a spoonful of very bitter green puree. They were all amused at its
                reception and my face in getting it down. Then there were raw onions cut up in
                cream. One hot vegetable soup, one hot milk, dry flap-jacks, a fresh orange and
                other vegetables and rice. Really a lot of food. Gandhi is experimenting with foods,
                trying tofind out the most economical for the village people and the most
                nourishing. The great majority are living a life of starvation. When you ask a
                villager how things are going, he points to his stomach and says, ‘<q who="UNK"
                    >Sahib, stomach too long empty</q>.’</p>
            <p>“We went on the roof to see the sun set, then in the tonga to the temple and now to
                evening prayers. At seven P.M. all twenty persons were seated with legs crossed
                under them onthe roof. They were all dressed in white, with the moon shining down
                and the stars overhead. Gandhiji and both woman guests were seated at the head of
                the circle. Since we came in a little late we sat in the circle near the poor
                ‘depressed’ woman workers who were not in white. <person reg="Gandhi, Devdas">Mr.
                    Gandhi’s son</person>, his youngest, is here. His <person
                    reg="Gandhi, Kanti Harilal">grandson</person> led the prayers in the moonlight.
                    <person reg="Gandhi, Kasturba Nakanji">Mrs. Gandhi</person> served our food and
                spices. She is a short, stoutish, unimpressive woman, but very kind and tender.
                After prayers, which were chanted, I went down to Gandhiji’s office; he wrote a few
                notes tome inviting me to walk in the morning, also saying that at seven thirty A.M.
                he will have a talk with me and it can be absolutely exclusive.”</p>
            <p><q who="EA"> The next morning Mrs. Sanger rose at six and went to meet Gandhi and the
                    two other woman guests. They </q>“all went with him to the village, San, which
                is his regular morning walk. He is trying t clean up the village by erecting
                ‘privies,’ portable on stilts to be moved from pit to pit to save the fertilizer and
                use it quickly. Gandhiji walks quickly and has his customary white robes, sandals
                and staff. We talked of food and diet. He has studied this question for forty years
                and disapproves of uncooked starches. After the walk I had a bath and dashed over to
                keep the seven thirty appointment on the roof in the morning sun. There were four of
                his people present and <person reg="Phillips, Anna Jane">Anna Jane</person> [Anna
                Jane Philips, Mrs. Sanger’s secretary] and myself. I am to return at three
                o’clock.”</p>
            <p><q who="EA">Mrs. Sanger goes on:</q> “At three o’clock promptly, we went to the
                Mahatma’s house and had our talk on the roof. He sat in the burning sunshine with a
                white cloth over his head. We sat inthe shade. the arguments were along the same
                line as inthe morning, but I am convinced his personal experience at the time of his
                father’s death was so shocking and self-blamed that he can never accept sex as
                anything good, clean or wholesome.”</p>
            <p><q who="EA">When a western woman of such international prominence as Mrs. Sanger has
                    a serious talk with the greatest Indian of our time on a subject so important
                    and controversial as birth control, we believe that what they had to say to each
                    othr on this occasion has historical as well as immediate value and should be
                    offered verbatim to our readers. Fortunately Mrs. Sanger’s secretary was present
                    at both the morning and afternoon interviews and took them down in shorthand. We
                    are therefore presenting this unusual interview, which has never before been
                    published. A few extracts from it were quoted in an article which Mrs. Sanger
                    wrote while she was in India for <title type="journal">The Illustrated Weekly of
                        India</title> and in the reply to Mrs. Sanger by <person
                        reg="Desai, Mahadev">Mahadev Desai</person> in Mr. Gandhi’s paper
                        <title>Harijan</title>--reprinted in part by <title type="journal">The
                        Illustrated Weekly of India</title>. We are presenting the interview exactly
                    as it took place between Mrs. Sanger and Gandhi, except to strike out a few
                    statements that duplicated what had gone before and to eliminate a few
                    unessential passages to save space.</q></p>

        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Morning</head>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: Mr. Gandhi, you and I have the interest of humanity at
                heart, but while both of us have that in common, you have greater influence with the
                masses of humanity. I believe no nation can be free until its women have control
                over the power that is peculiarly theirs, I mean the power of procreation....
                Women’s lack of control over fecundity results in overpopulation, in poverty, misery
                and war. Should women control this force which has made so much trouble in their
                lives? Do you see any practical solution for this problem, which in my humble
                opinion is the direct cause of much of the chaos in the world today?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">I suppose you know that all my life I have
                    been dinning into the ears of women the fact that they are their own mistresses,
                    not only in this but in all matters. I began my work with my own wife. While I
                    have abused my wife in many respects, I have tried to be her teacher also. If
                    today she is somewhat literate it is because I became her teacher. I was not the
                    ideal teacher because I was a brute. The animal passion in me was too strong and
                    I could not become the ideal teacher. My wife I made the orbit of al women. In
                    her I studied all women. I came into contact with many European women in
                        <place>South Africa</place>, but I knew practically every Indian woman
                    there. I worked with them. I tried to show them they were not slaves either of
                    their husbands or parents, that they had as much right to resist their husbands
                    as their parents, not only in the political field but in the domestic as well.
                    But the trouble was that some could not resist their husbands. I feel that I
                    speak with some confidence and knowledge because I have worked with and talked
                    with and studied many women. But the remedy is in the hands of the women
                    themselves. The struggle is difficult for them but I do not blame them. I blame
                    the men. Men have legislated against them. Man has regarded woman as his tool.
                    She has learned to be his tool and in the end found it easy and pleasurable to
                    be such, because when one drags another in his fall the descent is easy. I have
                    come in contact with some women of the West but not many, so that my deductions
                    about them may be faulty, but I have known tens of thousands of women in India,
                    their experiences and their aspirations. I have discussed it with some of my
                    educated sisters but I have questioned their authority to speak on behalf of
                    their unsophisticated sisters, because they have never mixed with them. The
                    educated ones have never felt one with them. But I have. they regarded me as
                    half a woman because I have completely identified myself with them. I have
                    identified myself with my wife to the same extent, but she observes certain
                    decencies with me, which I have not done with her. I intimately know her. I have
                    made use of her. But I do not suppose there are many women who can claim to have
                    followed their husbands so slavishly as she has. She has followed, sometimes
                    reluctantly, but her reluctance has had a tinge of obedience in it, for she is a
                    good Hindu wife. I have often challenged her and asked her to lead her own
                    independent life but she will not do so. She is too much a Hindu wife for that.
                    I have felt that during the years still left to me if I can drive home to
                    women’s minds the truth that they are free, we will have no birth control
                    problem in India. If they will only earn to say “no” to their husbands when they
                    approach them carnally! ... The real problem is that they do not want to resist
                    them. I have been reading about this cause which you advocate so eloquently. I
                    know some of the greatest people in the world agree with you. In India I would
                    mention only two great representative names, <person reg="Tagore, Rabindranath"
                        >Tagore</person> and <person reg="Naidu, Sarojini">Mrs. Naidu</person>. I
                    know I have them all arrayed against me. I have tried to think with them.... My
                    fudamental position is that so far as the women of India are concerned, even if
                    the method you advocate were a solution, it is a long way off, for the women of
                    India have so many things to think of now. Don’t tell me of the educated girl of
                    India. She will be your slave, much to her damage, I’m afraid.</q></p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: You mean for instance that the women of the chawls will be
                against me, the women in the tenements of <place reg="Bombay, India"
                >Bombay</place>?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Yes</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: I disagree with you. When I was in Bombay one of th first
                places I went was to these women of the tenements. I saw them sitting around, each
                with three, four or more children. We asked them how many children they had had, how
                many were dead. There were always some dead. Then we asked how many more they were
                going to have, and every woman but one held out her hands in supplication as though
                saying: “<q who="UNK">No more. Pray <name type="deity">God</name>, no more!</q>” It
                showed that they were already awakened to this idea. Again and again they ask what
                to do to prevent more children from coming into the world. I want to go to the
                villages and see whether this desire to have fewer children is not there. Let us not
                worry about the methods. Let us first discover whether they want more children or
                not. that will be the beginning.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">I don’t want to say that women want children
                    but that they will not do the thing that will keep them from having more
                    children. They will not resist their husbands. Then I suppose you will say, if
                    neither party resists, why should they not adopt artificial methods?</q></p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: You have been a great advocate of civil disobedience, Mr.
                Gandhi. Do you also recommend that the women of India adopt legal and marital
                disobedience?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Yes, I do. But no resistance bordering upon
                    bitterness will be necessary in ninety-nine out of a hundred cases. If a wife
                    says to her husband, “No, I don’t want it,” he will make no trouble. But she
                    hasn’t been taught</q>....</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: But that advice is not practical. It means a revolution in
                the home. It leads to divorce. The average marriage contract assumes that the
                married relationship will be harmonious.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">There should be mutual consent. Without it
                    the thing will be wholly wrong</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: that is right, but the problem is not often discussed by
                young people before marriage, although our young of today are beginning to discuss
                it more and more, which is a very good thing. But consider the turmoil, the
                unhappiness it means for the woman if she resists her husband! What if he puts her
                out of her home? In some states in the <place>United States</place> a wife has no
                rights if she resists her husband. What can she do? I do not know the law in India,
                but custom compels her to submit to the sexual needs of her husband.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">There are no such laws here</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: Yes, but the custom is here. Customs are harder to change
                than laws.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Yes</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: You are giving them advice which they cannot accept. Would
                it not make their condition worse?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Not if they learn the art of resistance. It
                    boils down to education. I want woman to learn the primary right of resistance.
                    She thinks now that she has not got it. Among the women of India it is most
                    difficult to drive home this truth. If I were to devote myself to birth control
                    I would miss this primary education</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: But cannot education go with birth control? In
                    <place>England</place> many social workers claim that if they can instruct the
                poorer women in birth control before their fifth child is born, before the women
                have fallen into poverty and drink and degradation, these women can be helped. In
                America in the clinics it has been found in a number of cased where women have been
                given birth control information and freed from undesired pregnancies for a period of
                from eighteen months to two years that the woman and her husband have become
                self-reliant and self-supporting and the case has been closed on the welfare books.
                The woman has more hope. She is not haunted by the fear of more and more and still
                more pregnancies. Every case shows a better condition of the woman’s mind, more
                patience, love, education in the woman’s life and home after she has been freed of
                the worry of having too many children. Mr. Gandhi, do you not see a great difference
                between sex love and sex lust? Isn’t it sex lust and not sex love which you
                oppose?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Yes, it is. But when both want to satisfy
                    animal passion without having to suffer the consequences of their act, it is not
                    love. It is lust. But if love is pure it will transcend animal passion and will
                    regulate itself. We have not had enough education of the passions. When a
                    husband says, “Let us not have children but have relations,” what is that but
                    animal passion? If they do not want to have any more children they should simply
                    refuse to unite</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: Then you hold that all sex union is lust except that for
                the specific purpose of having children?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Yes</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: I think that is a weak position, Mr. Gandhi. The act is the
                same. The force that brings two people together is sex attraction, a biological
                urge, which finds expression in sex union. There are two kinds of passion. One is a
                force around which centers respect, consideration and reverence known as love. The
                latter kind may be the stepladder to God. I do not call that kink of love lust, even
                when it finds expression in sex union, with or without children.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">I think there is a flaw in that position and
                    the world will not have to wait long before it discovers it. I have found the
                    same thing in old Sanskrit volumes, found lust clothed in the dress of love. But
                    I know from my own experience that, as long as I looked upon my wife carnally,
                    we had no real understanding. Our love did not reach a high plane. There was
                    affection, of course, between us. Affection there has been between us always but
                    we came closer and closer the more we, or rather I, became restrained. There
                    never was want of restraint on the part of my wife. Very often she would show
                    restraint, but she rarely resisted me although she shower disinclination very
                    often. All the time I wanted carnal pleasure I could not serve her. She would be
                    a fairly learned woman today if I had not let this lust interfere with her
                    education. She is not dull-witted, but it takes all one’s resources to drive
                    home a lesson. I had plenty of time at my disposal to teach her before I became
                    involved in public affairs but I didn’t take advantage of it. When I had
                    outlived animal passion and found a better mission in life, I had no
                time</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: I think lust is a very different thing from love. I believe
                in sex love. Perhaps love in sex is a new thing in our evolution, and develops in
                the human race as we evolve toward a higher consciousness. But it is usually
                acknowledged to be a very real thing, a force that cannot be denied....</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">May one man have pure sex lust with more than
                    one woman or a woman with more that one man? Your literature is full of
                that</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: Love, no. Lust, yes. But I think pure love comes of
                itself.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">No, it does not come of itself. If you have a
                    love for more than one woman, how do you know which is which?</q></p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: If we can have a choice in our mates there is a natural sex
                attraction between two people. You then have a different experience and in the
                experience an expression of love which makes you a finer human being. Sex lust is
                spent in prostitution, the sort of relationship which makes for oneness, for
                completeness between the husband and wife and contributes to a finer understanding
                and a greater spiritual harmony.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">You are talking in this strain because social
                    custom has restricted marriage to one at a time in the West, but in the East it
                    is not so. Many believe it lawful to have more than one wife. Or you may have a
                    wife and concubines. I have thought this question through. In the East this
                    practice has been going on a long time. Now I don’t ask this question to put you
                    in a corner. This is the argument I had with a woman with whom I almost fell. It
                    is so personal that I did not put it in my autobiography. We had considered if
                    there can be this spiritual companionship. the marriage relationship is a matter
                    of contract. Your parents arrange it in your childhood and you have nothing to
                    do with it. I come in contact with an illiterate woman. Then I meet a woman with
                    a broad, cultural education. Could we not develop a close contact, I said to
                    myself? This was a plausible argument, and I nearly slipped. But I was saved, I
                    awoke from my trance. I don’t know how. For a time it seemed I had lost my
                    anchor. I was saved by youngsters who warned me. I saw that if I was doomed,
                    they also were doomed. I decided I was not right in my argument</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: I wonder if this is a rationalization or a personal
                feeling. Even with those men who have concubines, don’t you think there is one
                person among the concubines to whom they are most devoted? When a man finds the one
                woman for him, their personalities tune in. There is harmony and growth in their
                union.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Have you read of the <title type="book"
                        >Mahabharata</title> legend where <person>Draupadi</person>, the heroine,
                    has five husbands? In its place this union has been glorified as the ideal
                    union. Each husband has his own complete right in the wife. Now in Islam, in
                    contrast, they let a man marry up to five wives on condition that all be treated
                    as upon the same level. The <person reg="Mohammed">Prophet</person> does not
                    call it lust and several philosophers in Islam defend the thing. I have talked
                    to many of these men. They think what is happening in the West is debasing and
                    that if all recognized polygamy the world would be better. The followers of
                    Islam can advance good arguments for it</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: We cannot speak for all nations. The human race is evolving
                like a class in school.... But I agree with you that we have to start with the
                individual. You feel that the beginning is with the individual’s control of sex.
                There is no argument there. But do you realize that from the time of marriage until
                the end of woman’s child-bearing period, if she has sex relations with her husband
                only once each year, she will have ten or twelve children? So that, even with the
                most continent life, she will be the victim of a large family which she cannot take
                care of. Must husbands and wives sacrifice their lives for this? Must this
                relationship, based on a finer quality of love, take place only three or four times
                in their entire lifetime?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Why should people not be taught that it is
                    immoral to have more than three or four children and that after they have had
                    that number they should live separately? If they are taught this it would harden
                    into custom. And if social reformers cannot impress this idea upon the people,
                    why not a law?</q> ...</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: The education that goes with birth control gives men and
                women a higher physical, mental and moral control. Isn’t there something you can
                approve that they can put into practice? Can’t you advise something practical,
                something that can be applied to solve the problem of too frequent child bearing for
                the mothers of India?</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Afternoon</head>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: Let us go back to your first point, continence. Do you
                accept the decision of most modern neurologists and physicians of the world that
                continence cannot be generally advised and except for particular cases its practice
                makes for great nervous and mental disturbances?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">I have read much on the subject. the evidence
                    is all based on examination of imbeciles. The conclusions are not drawn from the
                    practice of healthy minded people. The people they take for examples have not
                    lived a life of even tolerable continence. These neurologists assume that people
                    will be able to exercise self-restraint while they continue to lead the same
                    ill-regulated life. The consequence is that they do not exercise self-restraint
                    but become lunatics. I carry on a correspondence which many of these people and
                    they describe their own ailments tome. I simply say that if I were to present
                    them with this method of birth control, they would lead far worse lives</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: I just wondered because as you know there are many men who
                encounter this problem, who are not abnormal men but good fathers, hard workers, men
                who want to do right. I just want to give you two cases in particular.... These men
                are not vicious men. They are not brutes. They love their wives. They are trying to
                control a powerful force planted in their beings at birth. If that force is wrong
                and evil, why was it placed in their bodies by the Creator of all good?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">If bother are not ready it becomes
                    degradation for one to ask. If you eliminate birth control there will be other
                    methods. The case for birth control is not hopelessly weak, otherwise these
                    brilliant men would not be aligned with it. As in law, hard cases make bad law
                    and because you can cite hard cases does not prove your method right. We must
                    devise other means. As soon as you agree to eliminate certain methods as
                    harmful, you are bound to find others. In the cases you tell of, as soon as I
                    made the discovery I would have seen to it that the men and women were
                    separated</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: But what about the woman’s economic condition? She has had
                no preparation to support herself, especially in India. She has depended upon
                marriage and her husband for maintenance and her bread and butter. Who is to take
                care of the children? You must think of these things when you suggest
                separation.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">You must devise means. I might suggest that
                    the state take care of them. Or the law might be called in to give a divorce. At
                    present divorce is granted on grounds of infidelity. In the future it may be
                    granted on grounds of health. Even then some hard cases will occur</q>....</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: But, Mr. Gandhi, the advanced women of the western world
                have for the past decade or two refused to submit their bodies as receptacles for a
                man’s passion. Women have feelings as deep and as amorous as men. There are times
                when wives desire physical union as much as their husbands. Doesn’t that change the
                character of the relationship? Doesn’t that make a difference? In such cases where
                there is a fifty-fifty proposition regarding sex or marital expression, both feel
                this is a necessary part of the happiness of their lives. What have you to say in
                regard to this?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">I would devise other methods. I would not say
                    all methods have universal application. There would be ways of regulating or
                    curbing that passion. If artificial methods are to be avoided, other, natural
                    methods will have to be devised. Supposing that you and I as social reformers
                    said, “If this remedy is not open, we’ll have to fall back on others.” But the
                    difficulty of mutual approach stares us in the face, because I belong to a
                    generation that believes that life is made for self-restraint in every way of
                    life. Your generation believes in a multiplication of wants, freedom of all
                    human passions.... When you make up your mind to follow a code of ethics you
                    must determine to sacrifice health and ease. there are things more important
                    than health; things more precious that life and well-being</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: Yes, I agree that such things should not be imposed upon
                people. I am not attempting to force birth control upon any one. I am just offering
                the knowledge to help solve some difficult problems.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Ah yes, Mrs. Sanger, I know you are not
                    trying to impose birth control but there are some birth controllers who would
                    compel men and women to follow them</q>....</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: In the United States our birth rate is lowering. We have
                many older people now because people live longer. Then we have raised the age of
                marriage, which shortens a woman’s childbearing period. You think that your poorer
                people are not fertile? Where does your population increase come from then? Who has
                the large families?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">The burden of large families falls on the
                    middle class; as far as mere fertility is concerned, the fertility is greater
                    among the middle than the lower classes. If that was not true you would not have
                    the low average of five children per family for India. We do not have such a
                    terrible problem as you face in America or <place>Europe</place>. The problem is
                    with the middle class where indulgence is running riot. They use their wives as
                    playthings. I am sorry to have to say this, but it is true. I don’t say there is
                    no illicit intercourse among the poor in India but there is not the
                    fertility.... Take the lot of the millions--starvation. I have lived in it for
                    twenty-one days, but I had no passion. I do not mean to tell you that at
                    sixty-seven I have no passion, but I can regulate it</q>.</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: But, Mr. Gandhi, there are thousands, millions, who regard
                your word as that of a saint. How can you ask them who are so humble, so weak, to
                follow, when you are so much stronger and wiser, have taken years to bring about
                that self-control in your life?</p>
            <p>(Mr. Gandhi just smiled.)</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: But to come back to this point. Is the reason you object to
                artificial means of birth control because of the means or the act? ...</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Yes, I object for the latter
                reason</q>....</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: Have you from your experience in life seen that the people
                who have had no love in their lives, who have practised continence and restraint,
                are higher evolved persons than those who have lived normally?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">I can not lay down an absolute rule. I know
                    many fine people who have practised continence and restraint and many who have
                    not</q>....</p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: Haven’t you some message of encouragement that I can take
                away with me to help in this work which we are doing for humanity?</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">I can only say may <name type="deity"
                        >God</name> guide you right as you would say to me. We are only human
                    beings. I think highly of your purpose; otherwise I would not have given time to
                    this subject. With me God is truth. I would sacrifice everything, even India,
                    for the sake of truth. But if someone wanted to open my mind and tried to prove
                    I was living in a fool's paradise, I would not close my ears to him. Of course,
                    I should have little part with a man arguing a case for untruth, but I would let
                    him argue it and say, "Let untruth be as much God as truth and have as much
                    effect of me if it should.”</q></p>
            <p><emph>Mrs. Sanger</emph>: The good of humanity is in both our hearts, and I am the
                last person to say that the end justifies the means. But in birth control as in
                everything else the proper use of knowledge is very important. Everything good can
                be misused or used without control, and thus becomes harmful. When we give birth
                control information it goes hand in hand with education for the betterment of the
                children, the family and the race.</p>
            <p><emph>Mr. Gandhi</emph>: <q who="GANMO">Don’t go away with the idea that this has
                    been wasted effort. We have certainly come nearer together</q>.</p>
