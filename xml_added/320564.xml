        <head>Birth Control</head>
        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
        <p>Birth Control is a new philosophy of social relations which has recently arisen in this
            country, the basis of which is prevention of conception. It differs from other social
            philosophies in that it goes at once to the heart of the social problems of our times
            and applies to nearly every individual.</p>
        <p>In my work in the nursing field I came in daily contact with various aspects of social
            conditions, as they exist today. I was confronted with two classes of society. In the
            first class, where wealth, leisure, education are enjoyed, prevention of conception is
            known and practiced. The problems of the day do not come from this class. While on the
            other side, where prevention of conception is not known, we have poverty, disease,
            prostitution, drunkenness, vagrancy, unemployment, infant and maternal mortality, and
            the alarming increase in abortions.</p>
        <p>I found that the mothers of this class are kept in ignorance, but are anxious and
            desirous of the knowledge which will prevent their bringing children into world to die
            of poverty. I found that they would face death through abortions rather than bring
            children into the world and compel them to spend their childhood days toiling in mills
            and factories. I found that the great average woman, living on the average workingman's
            wage of $12 a week, does not want a large family, but is forced to endure the pains of
            childbirth because of her ignorance to prevent conception. The <place>United
                States</place> is forcing undesired motherhood upon millions of its women
            victims.</p>
        <p>And I claim that the state has no more right to ravish a woman against her will by
            keeping her in ignorance than a man has through brute force.</p>
        <p>The women of today do not desire to spend the whole of their adult lives in bringing
            children into the world, and refuse to be mere child-bearing machines. The state has not
            accorded women the dignity of freedom so long as her body remains the slave of
            ignorance, for no woman can call herself free who cannot choose the time to be a mother
            or not, as she sees fit. Out of this desire for voluntary motherhood has arisen this
            great struggle for woman's liberty, for the freedom of her own body, for its release
            from the domination of ignorance enforced by church and state. Out of this rebellion has
            risen the birth control movement in the United States.</p>
        <p>The astounding fact is, and statistics bear out the facts, that though there is a larger
            expenditure yearly in this country on charities, philanthropies and decadent
            institutions, such as penitentiaries, feeble-minded institutions, insane asylums, poor
            houses, reform schools, and the like, that these great funds do nothing but alleviate,
            that they do not touch the root of the cause, which is as agreed by all social workers
            and prominent medical and sociological authorities of the day throughout the world, the
            over-production of the poor, diseased and unfit population.</p>
        <p>Our social problems increase on all sides and can never be solved until those who are
            working for racial social betterment are free to discuss and to provide these victims of
            ignorance with knowledge and means to prevent conception. </p>
        <p>Our problems of war will never be solved until the birth rate is controlled by the people
            themselves. Birth control is practiced among the advanced and educated people of all
            countries. In <place reg="Netherlands">Holland</place>, <place>France</place>, and
                <place>New Zealand</place> it is quite generally practiced by the common people. The
            results of 30 years work in Holland should be known to all. The fact that during these
            years, with the fall of the birth rate, the death rate has fallen so perceptibly that
            the population has accelerated, is proof against the loud-mouthed orators who say that
            birth control means race suicide.</p>
        <p>Birth control means race improvement: it means fewer babies, but it also means less
            sickly and dead babies. It means fewer children to toil in factories and mills, but it
            means more babies playing in the open sunshine in the fields and playgrounds. It also
            means early marriage, free from the diseases which late marriage and promiscuous living
            bring. It means a wanted children born in love, reared in comfort. It means a freer
            womanhood: a healthier manhood. It means ultimately an emancipated race.</p>
