        <byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET SANGER</person></byline>
        <p>We are becoming a nation of business women as well as business men. No--I don’t mean
            merely those women who are carving careers for themselves in the professional world, who
            are succeeding as shopkeepers, as artists, as doctors, as decorators, or as social
            workers. I mean the humble "housewife" as well. Housekeeping nowadays has been put on a
            business basis; and not even the most incorrigible sentimentalist regrets the passing of
            the day when "woman’s work was never done." To-day American women revel in the
            discipline of housekeeping on the budget system. They delight in businesslike efficiency
            in the home. They have declared war on waste, dirt, and slovenliness. They have gained
            more freedom, more comfort and more happiness.</p>
        <p>And so a new generation of young American wives, a vast majority of whom have business
            experience before marriage, is beginning to approach the central problem in life--that
            of motherhood--in a new manner. In a word, these women are trying to put the business of
            bearing babies on a basis of intelligent efficiency. </p>
        <p>In this age of motor cars, aeroplanes, and radio, American women are refusing to conduct
            the most important businesses in life as it was conducted in the cave-dwelling
            period--which was by leaving the whole problem to chance! </p>
        <p>Like all important changes in civilization, this attempt to put the all-important
            profession of motherhood on a business basis has been denounced and derided. It has come
            as a shock to the older generation of sentimentalists, who were taught to close eyes,
            shut ears, and to never open mouths in public or in private concerning fundamental facts
            about parenthood. Such folk are really the descendants of <person rend="Luther, Martin"
                >Martin Luther</person>, who called to the bedside of a woman dying in childbirth is
            reported to have said: "<q who="LUTMA">If the woman grows weary and at last dies from
                childbearing, it matters not. Let her only die from bearing. She is there to do
                it.</q>" </p>
        <p>To-day we realize that this attitude is bad manners, worse morality, and thoughtlessly
            wasteful of the most precious possessions in the treasury of our vast natural
            resources--mother-power and child-life. To courageous, ambitious, young husbands and
            wives to-day, parenthood is a problem that cannot be left to chance. Childbearing is too
            costly a venture--both in precious lives and in money, to be indulged in carelessly,
            incessantly, continuously, without thought of the lives of the mother and the child. </p>
        <p>No gallant, chivalrous, sane-minded husband to-day would willingly ask his wife to
            descend into the valley of the shadow of death without taking every precaution for the
            health and well-being of his beloved and the new arrival. But, as <person
                rend="Albright, Ida">Ida Albright</person> recently pointed out in the <title
                type="journal">Atlantic Monthly</title>, in an article entitled “<title
                type="article">The High Cost of Babies</title>,” a proper confinement either in a
            hospital or at home runs ordinarily into hundreds of dollars, and very often into
            thousands. </p>
        <p>A generation or so ago, it cost approximately ten dollars apiece to bring babies into
            this world. But nowadays because we women are placing an even higher value on child-life
            and mother-life and insist that our children shall have a proper start, and that mothers
            shall not be drained of vitality and happiness by incessant childbearing, we are
            insisting more on quality and less on quantity. And however shocking it strikes the
            lingering sentimentalists of an older generation, and despite the fulminations and
            protests of certain gentlemen who are not concerned in the hazards of childbearing most
            intelligent American women are accepting the theory and practice of Birth Control. </p>
        <p>If Birth Control aims for fewer children per family, it means healthier, stronger,
            happier babies. </p>
        <p>Birth Control means conservation of mother-power and child-life. </p>
        <p>Fundamentally, Birth Control aims for the creation of a race of thoroughbreds. To create
            this race of well-born generations, we insist that the tested principles of sound
            agriculture and breeding are directly applicable to the human race, no less than to
            plants and animals. </p>
        <p>This does not mean that husbands and wives will be reduced to the servility of domestic
            animals. It means that they shall be induced to exercise more and more intelligence,
            self-discipline and guidance of their own procreative powers. If means that they are
            given a practical means by which all well-born children, the stalwart, sturdy, beautiful
            citizens of our America of tomorrow, may be conceived in love, born of the parent’s
            conscious desires, and begotten under conditions which insure the first right of every
            human being brought into this world--the heritage of health. </p>
        <p>Putting childbearing on a sound business basis--studying it, examining it, analyzing it,
            keeping the books of motherhood and starting budgets for babies, computing the cost of
            “overhead” and seeking to cut down waste and inefficiency--all this, I claim, does not
            mean that we mothers of the present generation are cold-blooded. It does not mean that
            we love babies less. It means that we love them more. We, too, can go into ecstasies
            over adorable “rosebuds”--particularly our own. But we modern mothers--and I have had
            some twenty years experience in this “baby business”--realize that we are not merely
            producing “better babies,” but the men and women of to-morrow--the Americans upon whom
            the whole future of our civilization depends. Is it anything to wonder at, then, that
            the “business” mother to-day is insisting in her whole particularly inalienable field,
            on “safety first” in motherhood? Is it not better for all concerned, the security of
            marriage itself, the health and economic well-being of the family, and the start in life
            of our young Americans in the making, that persons should stop, look and listen? </p>
        <p>Of all sides, if we take trouble to use our eyes, we are confronted with the spectacle of
            motherhood and childhood wrecked and ruined, state and federal governments burdened with
            the support of the victims of reckless and irresponsible parenthood.</p>
        <p>Since we are interested in babies and childbearing from the point of view of business, it
            may be well to look into the costs of quantity production as opposed to quality
            production of children and to find out if we can, which is in the long run more wasteful
            in human life, and because it is more wasteful, therefore immoral. </p>
        <p>On this point we have the evidence of impartial facts and figures. <org
                reg="United States Children's Bureau">The Children’s Bureau of the United States Department
                of Labor</org> has just completed a quiet and thorough investigation of the real
            cause of the deaths of young babies--infants who had not attained the age of one year.
            This report, which ought to be read by every American citizen, is easily obtained. It
            deals with the “causal” factors of infant mortality. </p>
        <p>Government investigators probed in to the intimate circumstances surrounding the deaths
            of no fewer than twenty-three thousand babies who died for one reason or another during
            the first twelve months of their sorry efforts to gain a foothold in this inhospitable
            old world of ours. The Government investigation was carried on with admirable
            thoroughness and impartiality in no less than eight typical cities, and the results,
            covering so wide a field, may be accepted as applicable to all cases since similar
            investigations carried on in <place>Great Britain</place> and other countries produced
            the same conclusions. </p>
        <p>One of the most important facts brought out is that the death rate for infants is highest
            when they are born at short intervals. </p>
        <p>It was shown that a <emph rend="italic">four-year interval between births is safest for
                the survival of babies</emph>.</p>
        <p>It was shown that the larger the family the fewer chances had each succeeding baby to
            survive the ordeals of its first year. </p>
        <p>It was found that the infant death rate increases with the increase in the amount of
            congestion and overcrowding in the home. It is two and one-half times as great in
            families with two or more persons to the room than in those which average less than one
            person a room. </p>
        <p>Where the father’s wage is low the infant mortality rate is high. Where the father’s
            income is relatively high the death rate for babies is low. In other words: Poverty is
            the great enemy of baby life. Poverty means lack of proper food, lack of hygienic
            sanitation. Poverty means an overcrowded house. Poverty means more babies than the
            mother can properly look after and more than the harassed father can support. But here
            we must recognize another curious factor. </p>
        <p>The bulk of the wealthy, the well-to-do, the educated and self-supporting classes in
            practically every civilized state now limit their families by the beneficent instrument
            of Birth Control. The vital statistics demonstrate this interesting fact. On the other
            hand, the poverty-stricken, the improvident, the criminal, the mentally and physically
            defective, are reckless and irresponsible. They exercise no control over their
            procreative faculties and incessantly flood society with numerous weakly defective and
            delinquent offspring. </p>
        <p>Many such cases have been brought to my attention. Undoubtedly many of my readers have
            been asked to help such “needy cases,” and yet charity only seems to aggravate the
            situation. I remember with a shudder the poignant case of an epileptic mother recently
            brought to my notice. The poor woman had brought no less than sixteen children into the
            world. The family was, of course, distressingly poor. The father was blind. Sixteen
            children, and only three of these escaped the more disastrous aspects of their
            hereditary blight. A volume might be written on the disorders of this ill-fated family,
            showing how poverty, disease defect ally themselves with crime, delinquency, and
            feeble-mindedness. </p>
        <p>Every year, thousands of letters are sent to me by overburdened mothers asking for aid to
            relieve them from the incessant travail of too frequent childbearing. From every state
            in the Union I receive these heartrending, inarticulate appeals of tortured souls
            crushed beneath the blind forces of cruelly prolific nature. To any one of imaginative
            and compassionate interest in womankind these letters represent a sort of Greek chorus
            of the martyred mothers of the world. Only the selfish and calloused could close their
            ears to these inarticulate despairing cries. And it is the troubled distant sound of
            these voices that spurs us on in our fight for the liberation of motherhood. </p>
        <p>I have received over one hundred and fifty thousand letters in the last two years. They
            are not pleasant to read but they present in a far more convincing and poignant fashion
            than cold statistics the real problem we, as a nation, face and exert all our
            intelligence and skill to solve. </p>
        <p>The efforts of American society to deal with the defective and delinquent classes,
            through charity and institutional care, are absolutely futile in curing this racial
            canker which is a national disgrace. </p>
        <p>One must live in an vast overcrowded city like <place rend="New York, NY">New
                York</place> to sense the tragedy of those wasted lives, these poor blighted babies
            and children, of whom it could be truthfully said--said in the spirit of utmost
            compassion--“It had been good for them if they had not been born.” Not only good for
            them, but good for the normal children upon whom they will at maturity become a heavy
            burden, and good for the future unfolding of American civilization. </p>
        <p>The efforts to meet the problem these blighted lives present has been met by organized
            charity and sentimentality. But the warm heart of <place rend="" reg="United States"
                >America</place> needs the balance of a cool head. When I think of the
            millions--nay, billions--of dollars annually spent in public and private charities, and
            of the failure of philanthropies to effect a cure. I am always reminded of the words of
                <person rend="Thompson, Francis">Francis Thompson</person>: “<q rend="THOFR">Before
                me stretched an immense, soundless, bitter ocean. On its shore stood a string of
                benevolent children, equipped with sugar bowls. What were they doing? They were
                throwing lumps of sugar into the sea to sweeten the waves.</q>” </p>
        <p>I think of that sea of humanity, a sea concealing in its dark depths the inarticulate
            smothered suffering of women and children, of women suffering in the endless torture of
            undesired childbearing, and unwanted blighted children whose little lives are soon
            snuffed out or who live wanly in overcrowded slums with insufficient elbow room for the
            movements of their stunted bodies, and with no chance of sunlight and fresh air and
            solitude for the essential development of body and soul. Thousands of them are condemned
            at a pitiably early age to become child laborers and to grow up to lead stunted and
            meager lives. </p>
        <p>But it is not along this appalling waste of infant and child-life that makes uncontrolled
            procreation a costly extravagance. Consider for a moment the sacrifice of life and
            health among the mothers. Motherhood, we admit, is a business--the most important
            business, one is tempted to claim, on the face of the earth, for it involves not only
            the past and the present, but the whole future of our civilization.But it is not along
            this appalling waste of infant and child-life that makes uncontrolled procreation a

            tempted to claim, on the face of the earth, for it involves not only the past and the
            present, but the whole future of our civilization.</p>
        <p>Motherhood is a hazardous profession. It involves tremendous risks. Health and strength
            are essential to its success. Scientific investigators insist that if the period of
            recuperation is cut short, if the mother is forced, too soon after the birth of one baby
            to undertake immediately the function of maternity. both the new-born baby and the mite
            of humanity still in the formative stage, suffer from malnutrition and are often
            permanently stunted. </p>
        <p>Let us not forget that while each parent gives fifty percent of the germ plasm, the
            mother nurtures the developing fetus for nine months. During this all-important period
            more damage may be done to the individual than at any time after birth. Scientist assure
            that happy, healthful, peaceful surroundings are absolutely essential for pregnant
            women, if we desire the citizens of the next generation to begin life with a fair start.
            Emotionally upset and unhappy women, on the verge of physical and mental breakdown,
            often give birth to defective children. Such children become burdens, often for life, on
            the community. Slave motherhood is thus a costly extravagance, not only for the
            individuals concerned, but for the nation at large. </p>
        <p>
            <emph rend="italic">The bill we pay for our hypocritical prudish refusal to face these
                facts runs into billions! </emph>
        </p>
        <p>Federal and state laws prohibit the dissemination of education concerning the basic facts
            of parental prudence and intelligent discipline of protective instincts. And yet
            American citizens are forced every year to pay billions of dollars for the maintenance
            of the victims of irresponsible parenthood. More than one-quarter of the total incomes
            of our states is expended upon the upkeep of asylums, prisons, hospitals, poorhouses,
            and such institutions for the care of the defective and delinquent. According to
            statistics gathered by the Federal Children’s Bureau, we as a nation are losing more
            mothers to childbirth to-day than we did ten years ago. Despite two years’ work in
            education under the federal act for the protection of maternity, and seven years’
            progress in local public health work, the maternal mortality rate has steadily and
            substantially increased. Almost every year in one of the thirty-one states of the birth
            registration area there is an increasing number of fatalities due to the hazards of
            maternity. The trend is steadily upward. Instead of making motherhood safe, as Professor
                <person reg="East, Edward M."> Edward M. East</person> of <org
                reg="Harvard University">Harvard</org> asserts, it is constantly growing more
            dangerous. </p>
        <p>And yet we allow our mothers to risk their lives in this way not once or twice or three
            times in a lifetime, but again, and again by innumerable pregnancies year after
            year.</p>
        <p>Such, briefly, is the “overhead” expense in this business of bearing babies. Such is the
            woeful waste to our great nation, the extravagant throwing away of precious mother-power
            and child-life of the policy of leaving the most important task of human life to chance
            and instinct. </p>
        <p>No business in the world, whether it be farming of stock-breeding, or fruit-growing, or
            merchandising or keeping a house or a store, could be conducted with this blind
            carelessness without driving the corporation into bankruptcy and disaster.</p>
        <p>Would the cattleman or stock-breeder dare breed from diseased stock? Would the gardener
            or farmer pay no attention to the kind of seeds he planted, or sentimentalize about the
            soil in which he planted them, without first assuring himself that it was nutritious?
            Would he overcrowd them in planting and sow them so that they would grow up stunted and
            overcrowded, and never possibly attain their full maturity? Of course not! </p>
        <p>As a nation we have made tremendous strides in agriculture, in industry, in machinery. We
            have state commissions for controlling the gypsy moth or boll weevil. We spent millions
            in combating foot-and-mouth disease among livestock. We pass stringent state and federal
            laws to protect wild game and shell fish. We have a huge movement to protect forests and
            conserve water power, and every day the awakening conviction that we must as a
            world-community protect our vast natural resources, becomes stronger and stronger. </p>
        <p>And yet, towards the conservation of our two greatest and most important “natural
            resources”--mother-power and child-life--figures prove that these United States of
            America are becoming less and less careful. We are every year losing more mothers in
            childbirth. And while the infant mortality rate may be decreasing, we are still
            confronted by the widespread evils of Child Labor and a vastly increasing problem of
            juvenile delinquency. </p>
        <p>It is high time that we begin, with all the energy and efficiency at our command, to
            cultivate our human garden, to apply the lessons we have learned in business and
            agriculture to our human livestock. At the end of his long career at his working his
            beneficent miracles for the good of America and humanity at large, <person
                reg="Burbank, Luther">Luther Burbank</person>, the wonder worker of plant life, is
            driven to the conclusion that something must be done immediately to save humanity from
            recklessly breeding itself to destruction. “<q who="BURLU">America.</q>” said this
            genius recently, “<q who="BURLU">is like a garden in which the gardener pays no
                attention to the weeds. . . .We have multiplied without scientific control, and
                to-day our criminals are reproducing their kind faster than any other class in the
                nation. Our criminals are our weeds, and weeds breed fast and are intensely hardy.
                They must be eliminated. . . . Nature eliminates the weeds, but we turn them into
                parasites and allow them to reproduce.</q>” </p>
        <p>Here then, is the situation: As I have said, and as everyone will agree, the bulk of the
            wealthy, educated, and intellectual classes--practically all the college-bred and
            business-bred representatives of the rising generation--are now using contraceptive
            methods to control the size of their families and to insure for their children a proper
            start in life. Nevertheless the poor, irresponsible, more improvident classes are adding
            to the financial burden of every American citizen and taxpayer, by flooding society with
            increasing numbers of defective children. </p>
        <p>If the birth rate of the “fit” is decreasing, and the birth rate of the “unfit” is
            increasing, will not the latter soon dominate? </p>
        <p>Here is one of the great problems America must face and solve. </p>
        <p>Is Birth Control an immoral, unnatural practice which is driving this country to
            destruction, as our enemies assert, or is it an avenue of racial salvation? How can
            education in Birth Control be brought to those who need it most? These questions I shall
            seek to answer in my next article.</p>
