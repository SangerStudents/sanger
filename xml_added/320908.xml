        <head>BIRTH CONTROL</head>
        <head type="sub">Illuminating Address by Noted Authority</head>
        <q who="RGCD">
            <p>Yesterday afternoon, in a Committee Room of the <org reg="Bermuda House of Assembly"
                    >House of Assembly</org>, members of the <org reg="Bermuda Department of Health"
                    >Board of Health</org> and <person reg="Browne, Arthur Heber">His Lordship the
                    Bishop of Bermuda</person>, listened to an address on the need for birth control
                in the modern world by Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>,
                Chairman of the <org>National Commission for Federal Legislation on Birth
                    Control</org>, and leader of the movement in the <place reg="United States"
                    >U.S.A.</place></p>
            <p>Col. <person reg="Dill, Thomas Melville">Dill</person>, stating that it was his
                privilege to introduce the speaker to her audience, emphasised what he has so often
                remarked upon in the House of Assembly, the fact that <place>Bermuda</place> had the
                almost uncanny knack of reproducing in very minute miniature many important world
                problems. Bermuda, on chart of the <place>North Atlantic</place>, is shewn as a mere
                comma, and yet, he said, he believed he was right in saying that she is one of the
                most densely populated of any place in the <place reg="United Kingdom"
                    >Empire</place>, beaten only by <place>Malta</place>, <place>Hong Kong</place>,
                and <place>Gibralter</place>.</p></q>
        <p>Mrs. Sanger said:-</p>
        <p>I feel that the movement that I represent owes a great debt of gratitude to those
            outstanding distinguished men and women in <place>England</place> who, from the
            beginning of this movement, have not only lent the dignity and prestige of their names
            to it, but have on many occasions thrown the whole weight of their influence to bring
            enlightenment to the English speaking world with regard to this question of limitation
            of population, more popularity known as birth control.</p>
        <p>This term was coined in America by a group of us who thought that the old terms of
            Malthusianism and Neo-Malthusianism, were rather controversial questions in England, and
            that the newer term of the control of the birth rate by means that prevent conception
            would reach the common mind more quickly than the long explanation of what Malthusianism
            meant. I spent two years in England studying the question men and women there who knew a
            good deal about population, its control and distribution, and more and more I came in
            contact with men like <person reg="Inge, William Ralph">Dean Inge</person>, who was one
            of those who had the courage, the fearlessness, to speak his mind, and felt
            responsibility in doing so. Later on, <person reg="Dawson, Bertrand Edward">Lord
                Dawson</person> of <place reg="Penn, England">Penn</place>, who went before the
                <org>Lambeth Conference</org>, and who there perhaps gave one of the most
            magnificent pronouncements on this question that ever had been given in this generation,
            when he said to the churchmen at that time that it was their duty to go forth and tell
            the healthy young men and women, starting out in marriage, that they were assuming one
            of the greatest responsibilities of the world today, the responsibility of passing on
            the gift of life. It was for the <org reg="Church of England">Church</org> to help them
            carry those responsibilities and to help them to meet the demands of the marriage. And
            in his address at that time, he said, that unless the churchmen would open their eyes
            and ears and go forth and speak that they would soon be closing their doors.</p>
        <p>It was about a year, I think before the Lambeth Conference came out and made a statement,
            and it was rather a conservative statement then; but, considering the time, and the
            newness of the subject from a scientific point of view, and from the war of controversy
            that it had waged in England, I think it was perhaps a very courageous thing for them to
            take the stand they did, in which they claimed that according to Christian principles
            and ethics, that an individual had a right to practice contraception according to his
            conscience.</p>
        <p>That started a controversy.</p>
        <p>There was then issued the Encyclical from the <org reg="Roman Catholic Church">Church of
                Rome</org>--from the <org>Vatican</org>.</p>
        <p>The <org>British Medical Association</org>, upon clause 3, came forth and stated where
            they stood. They said that they would not be dictated to by any group, for or against;
            they were going to take their stand upon the question of whether it was a human thing.
            That was a very courageous and splendid position to take. It was a medical proposition
            and the medical men would not be dictated to, either by propagandists, pro or con. That
            was a most splendid stand, because it influenced the medical profession in other
            countries. It was the way they felt and should feel.</p>
        <p>A few years later, in 1931, the <org reg="British Ministry of Health">Ministry of
                Health</org>, through the <org>Maternity and Infant Welfare Agencies</org>, claimed
            that they had a right to give information to the mothers who came to the <org>Maternity
                Centres</org> whenever there was a disease condition, or a condition that made
            pregnancy or childbirth a hardship, and later they followed that up by another statement
            maintaining that any disease that was hazardous to pregnancy, or childbearing was a
            condition upon which the physician should have the right to inform the mother against
            pregnancy.</p>
        <p>And so we have had, one after the other, step by step, these outstanding men taking a
            stand that I believe future generations will bless them for I have always been
            encouraged in the many ups and downs one has in a cause of this kind in remembering the
            words of <person reg="Hugo, Victor">Hugo</person> "<q who="HUGVI">There is no force in
                the world so great as that of an idea who's hour has struck</q>." I believe that
            twenty years ago the time had come for people to think of progeny, not for their own
            convenience, but to think of it in relation to the future; to consider is as a
            qualitative factor; and to realise that there must be a consciousness in bringing life
            into being, not letting it be an accident-an accidental result of conduct; but more and
            more is should be a serious thing planned with a sense of responsibility for the child,
            its welfare, and for the race generally.</p>
        <p>I think perhaps never before in the history of mankind is the ideal so important to put
            before the people of the world as today. There is no subject that has so large a
            practical significance, which at the same time goes so deeply into the foundations of
            social evolution, as this same question, the conscious control of birth. There is no
            other subject of equal importance that has been left so long in equal obscurity, and yet
            none that can shew so unequalled an in-interest, an interest which has leaped horizons
            nationally and internationally, as the subject has done in the past ten years, because
            it is of interest to the average man and woman. It goes close to them. Every married man
            and woman must think of this question, must want to know what there is to know,
            individually. And communities, those in charge of health of communities, must certainly
            long to do something to prevent the coming of children into the strata of life when it
            will be difficult to give them adequate means to carry though.</p>
        <p>When I met <person reg="Keynes, John Maynard">John Maynard Keynes</person> in <place
                reg="Geneva, Switzerland">Geneva</place> in 1925 he was looking rather depressed and
            rather gloomy. He had then been sent down to Geneva by the <org>British Government</org>
            to the <org>League of Nations</org> to do something fine towards establishing
            international peace. Mr. Keynes said to me, "<q who="KEYJO">I am discouraged because
                they are not striking at fundamentals. They do not want to think of one fundamental
                question, and that is the population question. There is not a city, not a country,
                in the League of Nations today that will accept it, or discuss it, and until the
                nations of the world are willing to sit down and talk about their problems from the
                population point of view, its rate of growth, its distribution, and its quality,
                they might just as well throw their peace proposals into the waste basket, because
                they will never have international peace until they do consider that problem</q>." I
            think he was a prophet.</p>
        <p>I am more convinced today as history has shown with <place>Italy</place>,
                <place>Germany</place>, <place>Japan</place>-which have been long danger spots in
            the world, bound to move over geographical course from sea to sea-that John Maynard
            Keynes was right, and that in order to have international peace we must have population
            control.</p>
        <p>There used to be three means of control, birth, death and immigration. But since 1924
            when the United States closed its doors against Immigration the rest of the world felt
            that bar, because the United States was the open door into which the surplus population
            of the world, especially of <place>Europe</place>, had poured for over a hundred
            years.</p>
        <q who="RGDC">
            <p>Continuing, Mrs. Sanger said: since 1924, in spite of this we have increased
                twenty-five million, and we have ten million people on relief and sixtyfive percent
                of the birth rate in the last three years has come from those people on relief.</p>
            <p>After speaking of the economic situation in the United States and the possible ways
                of attacking the problem, Mrs. Sanger said that in Every country there were two
                groups, the group that has controlled its birth rate, and the groups that has not.
                It was the intelligent educated people who had controlled the size of their family,
                and the ignorant, usually the diseased and poor people who had not. She drew
                attention to the fact that the children of controlled families were able to enter
                schools, trade colleges, college, and universities and were not obliged to enter
                factories and mines.</p></q>
        <p>“During the child-bearing period” <q who="RGDC">said Mrs. Sanger,</q> "women can produce
            from two to twenty children, according to their reproductive capacity, without
            interrupting their pregnancy, and that is the problem that England and the United States
            is facing today.</p>
        <q who="RGDC">
            <p>Mrs. Sanger quoted many statistics which appeared to establish her plea for a
                deliberate consideration of necessity for informing men and women of the means of
                preventing conception, and urged that it was a medical question, and asked why,
                since a woman of means could afford to visit a doctor and obtain from him privately
                in his surgery information which enabled her to control her family, a poor woman,
                faced with the possibility of pregnancy when in poor health and in fortuitous
                circumstances, should not be able to obtain the same information by means of a
                clinic established for such a purpose.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger, stated that the movement with which she was associated did not consider
                that early marriages were to be avoided, but that early parenthood was not
                desirable, since it was better for men and women to be thoroughly balanced,
                physically, mentally and nervously, before reproducing life. She considered, too,
                that pre-natal information was of great assistance to young pregnant woman.</p>
            <p>Another important aspect of the case was emphasised by Mrs. Sanger when she spoke of
                the transmission of disease, and also of the undesirability of women suffering from
                what are regarded as perhaps common complaints, minor heart diseases goiter and so
                on from being subject to child birth.</p>
            <p>At the end of the address, <person reg="Williams, L.J.">Dr. L.J. Williams</person>,
                in response to a request for questions, asked whether the contraceptive methods
                recommended by the Movement with which Mrs. Sanger is associated could be guaranteed
                one hundred per cent.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger stated that that was a difficult question to answer, but that of 10,000
                cases analysed in <place reg="New York City, NY">New York</place>, the failures were
                classified in two categories, the technical failure and the human failure. The
                technical failure was responsible for only two and a half per cent of the cases, and
                the human failure-negligence and carelessness of the prospective mother-was
                responsible for seven and a half per cent.</p>
            <p>Col. Dill asked His Lordship the Bishop to say a few words.</p>
            <p>His Lordship stated that he was there by courtesy of invitation and because he
                thought that it was his duty to hear what was said. He had spent, he said, a very
                painful time because he entirely disagreed with the speaker, though of course he did
                not question her sincerity. He said that he was sure that without any intention Mrs.
                Sanger had, as so many other people also had done, misrepresented the most
                unfortunate pronouncement of Resolution 15 of the Lambeth Conference of 1930. He was
                thankful to say that he was one of a strong minority who resisted the passing of the
                resolution, not because they were in entire disagreement with what was said, as
                because they were sure that the effect that it would produce in the world would be
                lamentable and in the years that have been passed that has been shewn to have been
                the case. He agreed most emphatically with Mrs. Sanger upon one point, and that was
                the grave responsibility incumbent upon every parent of transmitting disease,
                particularly the transmission of mental instability. He said that he would like to
                press that point home because there was a desire to face fact, then that fact should
                most certainly be faced. He concluded his brief remarks by recommending the speaker
                to follow the example of <person reg="Stopes, Marie">Dr. Marie Stopes</person>.</p>
            <p>(We take this to refer to the fact that Dr. Stopes was recently admitted to the Roman
                Catholic Church which refuses to recognize birth control, and apparently forbids its
                members any independent thought upon the subject. The recommendation will not find
                favour with those who prefer reason to dogma--Editor.</p>
            <p>Col. Dill in thanking Mrs. Sanger said that there were undoubtably two points of view
                antagonistic on to the other, but he believed that it would be possible after due
                deliberation to resolve the two conflicting opinions.</p></q>
