            <p>The <org>Birth Control Federation of America, Inc</org>. by vote of its members at
                the Annual Meeting in January 1942, changed its name to <org>Planned Parenthood
                    Federation of America, Inc</org>., as more indicative of its aims and purposes.
                Work during the year was concentrated on: (1) inclusion of pregnancy spacing in more
                State Health Departments; (2) stimulation of adequate teaching of contraception in
                medical schools and wider distribution to physicians, of a condensed authoritative
                text by <person reg="Dickinson, Robert Latou">Robert L. Dickinson</person>, on
                techniques of conception control; (3) raising funds for research, and (4) continuing

            <p>Copies of a new edition of Dr. Dickinson’s <title type="book">Techniques of Conception
                    Control</title>” were sent, on request, to 45,000 physicians and medical
                schools. Returns on a questionnaire sent to 34,000 of those receiving the pamphlet,
                showed that the doctors greatest interest was in technique. A syllabus for teaching
                contraception in medical schoold was drawn up, to be sent for their consideration to
                heads of these institutions.</p>

            <p>The Federation raised funds for research in various aspects of human fertility, to be
                conducted under the guidance of the <org>National Committee on Maternal
                Health</org>. These studies are long range projects; results will be announced at
                their termination. There is still urgent need for research in simpler effective
                contraceptive methods. Among the independent clinical studies on simple forms of
                contraception, were those of <person reg="Stein, Irving R.">Irving R.

                    <place>Kentucky</place>. All of these studies showed a varying reduction in
                fertility among the cases advised. Clinic Reports show diaphragm and jelly the
                choice of doctors in private practice; in public health clinics foam powder and
                sponge seemed to give adequate protection when regularly used. the non-use of a
                method, occasionally, was the human factor which faced doctors in all branches of
                preventive medicine.</p>
            <p>The <org reg="American medican Association Council on Chemistry and Pharmacy">Council
                    on chemistry and Pharmacy</org> of the American Medical Association appointed a

                contraceptive preparations, and the Medical Sub-Committee of the <org>Family
                    Planning Association</org> of Great Britain appointed a special As-Hoc Committee

            <p>A two-year Negro child-spacing demonstration project was successfully carried out
                under the most difficult conditions to provide proof that under public health
                direction the benefits of planned parenthood can reach and will receive acceptance
                by even the poorest and most illiterate groups. Negro leaders in the fields of
                medicine, education and social welfare gave active support to a national educational
                campaign.</p>

                    the State law on contraception was constitutional and that under it no doctor
                    could advise the use of contraceptives even in cases where the life of a patient
                    was threatened by pregnancy. In November, the <org

                    to wehther physicians in that state could legally advice patients on
                    contraceptives, when life or health were threatened by pregnancy.</p>

            <p>In Great Britain birth control clinics remained open and an increase in the number of
                patients was reported. Conscription of women for war work led to a demand for
                contraceptive by many who could not carry on in th country’s war effort if they
                became pregnant. Medical Officers of Health were reported as cooperating, in many
                countries by referring cases to clinics for advice. Elsewhere in
                    <place>Europe</place> no information filtered through, beyond and authentic
                report from <place>Germany</place> that contraceptives were among the few articles
                still advertised for sale in a number of large cities. Germany,
                <place>Italy</place>, and <place>Japan</place> were all pressing frantically for
                higher birth rates. this policy, accompanied by suppression of birth control
                information did not bring the desired results.</p>
