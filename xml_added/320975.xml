        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <p>The <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>, Inc., formerly the <org>Birth
                Control Federation of America</org>, Inc. made marked advances in 1943,
            concentrating on five programs of activity.</p>
        <div>
            <head rend="sub">Public Health.</head>
            <p>-- Five more states initiated cooperative efforts with the federation to include
                pregnancy spacing in their public health services -- bringing the total number of
                states to eleven. The federation became a member of the <org>National Health
                    Council</org>.</p>
            <p><emph>Clinical Service.</emph> -- On Dec. 1, 1943 birth control services totalled
                786; 211 in hospitals; 286 in public health quarters; 288 extra-mural; 372 of total
                supported in whole or part by public funds. Services for treatment of sterility were
                listed in the federation’s <title type="book">Clinic Directory</title>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head rend="sub">Industrial Hygiene.</head>
            <p>-- Absenteeism, due often to pregnancy or induced abortion, became an acute problem
                in many areas, as millions of women went into war work. the division of industrial
                hygiene, <org reg="United States Public Health Service">U.S.P.H. service</org>,
                recommended, in an outline for use in industry, that “<q who="USPHS">advice on the
                    proper spacing of children, as a means of protecting the health of the mother
                    and her children</q>”, be given married women workers, by counsellors in plants.
                Dr. <person reg="Dodge, Eva">Eva Dodge</person>, the federation’s assistant medical
                director, surveyed a number of plants, and, in co-operation with the
                    <place>Alabama</place> state health department, assisted in preparing two
                pamphlets on this problem, for use by workers and management. A radio transcription,
                    “<title type="article">Freedom From Fear</title>”, dealing with the problem of
                absenteeism, due to pregnancy, was produced by the federation for use of its state
                leagues.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head rend="sub">Education.</head>
            <p><emph>Medical.</emph> -- Over 11,000 copies of Dr. <person
                    reg="Dickinson, Robert Latou">Robert L. Dickinson</person>’s pamphlet, “<title
                    type="book">Techniques of Conception Control</title>”, were sent on request to
                physicians, bringing the total to 56,000 issued on request to this group, and 17,000
                were sent to registered nurses on request.</p>
            <p>Birth control training institutes for public health nurses were held in
                    <place>Florida</place>, <place>Delaware</place> and <place>North
                    Carolina</place>.</p>
            <p><emph>Research.</emph> -- Although no new discoveries were made during the year, a
                special committee of the council on pharmacy and chemistry of the <org>American
                    Medical Association</org> continued research in chemical contraceptives, and the
                council on physical therapy initiated a co-operative program dealing with mechanical
                articles and devices. Reports appear in the <title type="journal">Journal of the
                    American Medical Assn.</title> for Dec. 18, 1943.</p>
            <p><emph>Social Work.</emph> -- A new pamphlet, “<title type="book">The Case Worker and
                    Family Planning</title>”, was sent upon request to 2,000 social workers. The
                federation participated, as a kindred group, in the <org>National Conference of
                    Social Work</org>. A newly formed advisory committee directed work in this
                field.</p>
            <p><emph>Negro Program.</emph> -- The <org
                    reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Division of Negro Service"
                    >division of Negro Service</org>, with its advisory council of 46, and
                sponsoring committee of 146 members, representing national professional, medical,
                religious and civic leadership, was strengthened, and a pamphlet, “<title
                    type="book">Better Health for 13,000,000</title>" published, reporting on the
                program of family planning for Negroes.</p>
            <p><emph>Religious.</emph> -- The <org
                    reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America, National Clergyman's Advisory Council"
                    >National Clergymen’s Advisory council</org> was organized with almost 1000
                members from 46 states. Organization of the council, and election of officers was
                undertaken, and a pamphlet on “<title type="book">Marriage Counsel</title>”, for use
                of the clergy published.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head rend="sub">Teaching in Medical Schools.</head>
            <p>-- To stimulate better teaching of contraception in medical schools, Dr. <person
                    reg="Brown, W. E.">W.E. Brown</person> of <org>Cincinnati Medical School</org>,
                visited 26 grade A colleges, for the federation, finding some teaching of the
                subject in each. His teaching Syllabus was distributed to grade A schools throughout
                the <place reg="United States">U.S.</place>, 45% of which were giving some
                instruction in 1943.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head rend="sub">State Organizations.</head>
            <p>--In 9 affiliated states, <place>Maryland</place>, <place>Delaware</place>,
                    <place>West Virginia</place>, <place>Virginia</place>, <place>Florida</place>,
                    <place>Iowa</place>, <place>Minnesota</place>, <place>Tennessee</place> and
                    <place>Missouri</place>, programs were broadened and strengthened by addition of
                professional staff members and executives. One more state, <place>Ohio</place>,
                became affiliated, bringing the total to 34.</p>
            <p><emph>Legal.</emph> -- The <org reg="United States Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme
                    Court</org> refused the <name type="case" reg="Tileston v. Ullman"
                    >Tileston</name> case involving the right of <place>Connecticut</place> doctors
                to advise contraceptives where life or health were threatened.</p>
            <p><emph rend="italics"><place>Massachusetts</place> Referendum.</emph> -- Although over
                half a million votes were cast in its favour, the referendum to amend the state law
                so that doctors might legally advise patients on contraception failed of
                passage.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">International.</head>
            <p> -- The war made organized work in occupied <place>Europe</place> impossible. In
                    <place>Great Britain</place> educational work, clinical service and research
                were continued by the <org>Family Planning Association</org>. In
                    <place>Australia</place> the law passed in 1942 did not interfere with clinical
                work. Health boards in <place>Bermuda</place> planned wider disemination of birth
                control information, to cope with the problem of overpopulation there.</p>
            <p>Birth rates fell in most of Europe but were higher than in years in Great Britain. In
                the United States they were higher than for 20 years past. (See also Birth
                Statistics)</p>
