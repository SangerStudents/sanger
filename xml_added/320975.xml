        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <p>The <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>, Inc.,
            formerly the <org>Birth Control Federation of America</org>, Inc.
            made marked advances in 1943, concentrating on five programs of
            activity.</p>
        <div>
            <head rend="sub">Public Health.</head>
            <p>-- Five more states initiated cooperative efforts with the
                federation to include pregnancy spacing in their public health
                services -- bringing the total number of states to eleven. The
                federation became a member of the <org>National Health
                    Council</org>.</p>
            <p><emph>Clinical Service.</emph> -- On Dec. 1, 1943 birth control
                services totalled 786; 211 in hospitals; 286 in public health
                quarters; 288 extra-mural; 372 of total supported in whole or
                part by public funds. Services for treatment of sterility were
                listed in the federation’s <title>Clinic Directory</title>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head rend="sub">Industrial Hygiene.</head>
            <p>-- Absenteeism, due often to pregnancy or induced abortion,
                became an acute problem in many areas, as millions of women went
                into war work. the division of industrial hygiene, <org
                    reg="United States Public Health Service">U.S.P.H.
                    service</org>, recommended, in an outline for use in
                industry, that “<q who="USPHS">advice on the proper spacing of
                    children, as a means of protecting the health of the mother
                    and her children</q>”, be given married women workers, by
                counsellors in plants. Dr. <person reg="Dodge, Eva">Eva
                    Dodge</person>, the federation’s assistant medical director,
                surveyed a number of plants, and, in co-operation with the
                    <place>Alabama</place> state health department, assisted in
                preparing two pamphlets on this problem, for use by workers and
                management. A radio transcription, “<title>Freedom From
                    Fear</title>”, dealing with the problem of absenteeism, due
                to pregnancy, was produced by the federation for use of its
                state leagues.</p>

        <div>
            <head rend="sub">Education.</head>
            <p><emph>Medical.</emph> -- Over 11,000 copies of Dr. <person
                    reg="Dickinson, Robert Latou">Robert L. Dickinson</person>’s
                pamphlet, “<title>Techniques of Conception Control</title>”,
                were sent on request to physicians, bringing the total to 56,000
                issued on request to this group, and 17,000 were sent to
                registered nurses on request.</p>
            <p>Birth control training institutes for public health nurses were
                held in <place>Florida</place>, <place>Delaware</place> and
                    <place>North Carolina</place>.</p>
            <p><emph>Research.</emph> -- Although no new discoveries were made
                during the year, a special committee of the council on pharmacy
                and chemistry of the <org>American Medical Association</org>
                continued research in chemical contraceptives, and the council
                on physical therapy initiated a co-operative program dealing
                with mechanical articles and devices. Reports appear in the
                    <title>Journal of the American Medical Assn.</title> for
                Dec. 18, 1943.</p>
            <p><emph>Social Work.</emph> -- A new pamphlet, “<title>The Case
                    Worker and Family Planning</title>”, was sent upon request
                to 2,000 social workers. The federation participated, as a
                kindred group, in the <org>National Conference of Social
                    Work</org>. A newly formed advisory committee directed work
                in this field.</p>
            <p><emph>Negro Program.</emph> -- The <org
                    reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Division of Negro Service"
                    >division of Negro Service</org>, with its advisory council
                of 46, and sponsoring committee of 146 members, representing
                national professional, medical, religious and civic leadership,
                was strengthened, and a pamphlet, “<title>Better Health for
                    13,000,000</title>" published, reporting on the program of
                family planning for Negroes.</p>
            <p><emph>Religious.</emph> -- The <org
                    reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America, National Clergyman's Advisory Council"
                    >National Clergymen’s Advisory council</org> was organized
                with almost 1000 members from 46 states. Organization of the
                council, and election of officers was undertaken, and a pamphlet
                on “<title>Marriage Counsel</title>”, for use of the clergy
                published.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head rend="sub">Teaching in Medical Schools.</head>
            <p>-- To stimulate better teaching of contraception in medical
                schools, Dr. <person reg="Brown, W. E.">W.E. Brown</person> of
                    <org>Cincinnati Medical School</org>, visited 26 grade A
                colleges, for the federation, finding some teaching of the
                subject in each. His teaching Syllabus was distributed to grade
                A schools throughout the <place reg="United States"
                >U.S.</place>, 45% of which were giving some instruction in
                1943.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head rend="sub">State Organizations.</head>
            <p>--In 9 affiliated states, <place>Maryland</place>,
                    <place>Delaware</place>, <place>West Virginia</place>,
                    <place>Virginia</place>, <place>Florida</place>,
                    <place>Iowa</place>, <place>Minnesota</place>,
                    <place>Tennessee</place> and <place>Missouri</place>,
                programs were broadened and strengthened by addition of
                professional staff members and executives. One more state,
                    <place>Ohio</place>, became affiliated, bringing the total
                to 34.</p>
            <p><emph>Legal.</emph> -- The <org reg="United States Supreme Court"
                    >U.S. Supreme Court</org> refused the <name type="case"
                    reg="Tileston v. Ullman">Tileston</name> case involving the
                right of <place>Connecticut</place> doctors to advise
                contraceptives where life or health were threatened.</p>
            <p><emph rend="italics"><place>Massachusetts</place>
                    Referendum.</emph> -- Although over half a million votes
                were cast in its favour, the referendum to amend the state law
                so that doctors might legally advise patients on contraception
                failed of passage.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub">International.</head>
            <p> -- The war made organized work in occupied <place>Europe</place>
                impossible. In <place>Great Britain</place> educational work,
                clinical service and research were continued by the <org>Family
                    Planning association</org>. In <place>Australia</place> the
                law passed in 1942 did not interfere with clinical work. Health
                boards in <place>Bermuda</place> planned wider disemination of
                birth control information, to cope with the problem of
                overpopulation there.</p>
            <p>Birth rates fell in most of Europe but were higher than in years
                in Great Britain. In the United States they were higher than for
                20 years past. (See also Birth Statistics)</p>
