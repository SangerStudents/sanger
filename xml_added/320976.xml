        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <div type="section">
            <p>The <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>, Inc., formerly the
                    <org>Birth Control Federation of America</org>, Inc., and its 37 affiliated
                state leagues expanded the national state and local programs in 1944.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Medical and Public Health.–</head>
            <p>The <org reg="American Medical Association, Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry"
                    >Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</org> of the American Medical association
                began to test all contraceptive products and to report thereon and two more state
                medical societies, <org reg="Iowa Medical Society">Iowa</org> and <org
                    reg="Minnesota Medical Association">Minnesota</org>, passed resolutions
                favourable to Planned Parenthood as a medical and public health service.</p>
            <p>Copies of the manual, “<title type="book">Techniques of Conception Control</title>,”
                were requested from the federation by 47,000 physicians throughout the country.</p>
            <p>Increasing emphasis on the positive phases on its program, the federation published
                and distributed a pamphlet, “<title type="book">To Those Denied a Child</title>” to
                assist childless couples in understanding the problem and knowing what medical
                facilities were available for treatment.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Education.–</head>
            <p>New technical manuals were published and copies were requested by 21,000 nurses,
                11,000 clergymen, 4,000 social workers and 1,300 professors of sociology. Refresher
                courses for nurses were held in six states reaching some 1,000 nurses particularly
                in the public health field.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Research.–</head>
            <p>Research in chemical contraceptives was undertaken in two university laboratories. No
                new discoveries were made. Two awards of $500 were offered by the federation for
                scientists making the most significant contribution to research in contraception and
                the correction of sterility.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Social Work.–</head>
            <p>The federation retained a full-time social work consultant on its staff. <title>An
                    Outline for a Course in Planned Parenthood</title> by <person
                    reg="Cannon, Mary Antoinette">Mary A. Cannon</person>, professor of social work,
                    <org>Columbia University</org>, <place reg="New York">N.Y.</place>, was
                published as a teaching guide for courses in schools of social work and colleges.
                The federation and many of its affiliated state leagues participated in the
                    <org>National and State Conferences of Social Work</org> and in institute
                programs on marriage and the family.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Negro Program.–</head>
            <p>A full-time consultant on work with Negroes was added to the staff, to co-ordinate
                work in this field. Assistance was given in 14 states and the <place
                    reg="Washington, DC">District of Columbia</place>. The <org>National Planning
                    Committee on Work with Negroes</org> was formed, held regular meetings, and
                issued two printed appeals for support and action. The <org>National Medical
                    Association</org>, the <org>National Negro Insurance association</org>, the
                    <org>National Council of Negro Women</org> and the <org>National Conference of
                    Colored Parent-Teachers</org> associations were among the national organizations
                affirming or reaffirming their support of the Planned Parenthood program.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Religious.–</head>
            <p>The <org
                    reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America, National Clergymen’s Advisory Council"
                    >National Clergymen’s Advisory council</org>, with more than 1,000 members, was
                organized to carry on an active program; and officers, regional chairmen and an
                executive committee were elected by its members.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Press and Radio.–</head>
            <p>Articles appeared in 32 magazines, and more than 50 radio stations put the
                federation’s transcription of “<title type="article">Freedom from Fear</title>” on
                the air.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">State Organizations.–</head>
            <p>Five states and the District of Columbia added professional workers to their staffs
                and all were given orientation at national headquarters.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">International.–</head>
            <p>Other groups continued activities in <place>Great Britain</place> and
                    <place>India</place>, but the war disrupted all other organized effort. A royal
                commission, to study population trends, was setup in <place>England</place>, where
                the birth rate was the highest in many years and the nation’s general health was the
                best in years in spite of the war. Population growth in the neutral countries of
                    <place>Sweden</place>, <place>Switzerland</place> and <place reg="Ireland"
                    >Eire</place> was reported. India’s population continued its increase and
                leaders there advocated birth control as partial answer to the problem. In other
                countries in <place>Europe</place> birth rates were low, although
                    <place>Germany</place> alleged a rise, which, if true, might be due to the
                policy of stimulating illegitimacy. (For U.S. births, see CENSUS DATA, 1944.)</p>
            <p><place reg="Soviet Union">Russia</place> adopted a new policy to stimulate its birth
                rate, including state aid to mothers of large families, with medals and honourary
                titles added.</p>
            <p><place>Canada</place> also adopted a “child allowance” policy, to cover all children
                from birth to 16 years. A substitute for the <person reg="Beveridge, William"
                    >Beveridge</person> plan was presented in Great Britain, which would provide
                compulsory insurance covering, among other things, maternity benefits and family
                allowances. The question of attempting to ban the sale of contraceptives, and thus
                stimulate the birth rate, was debated n parliament, but not adopted, because of
                vigorous opposition to such a policy. (See also BIRTH STATISTICS.)</p>
