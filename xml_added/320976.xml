        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <div type="section">
            <p>The <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>, Inc.,
                formerly the <org>Birth Control Federation of America</org>,
                Inc., and its 37 affiliated state leagues expanded the national
                state and local programs in 1944.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Medical and Public Health.–</head>
            <p>The <org
                    reg="American Medical Association Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry"
                    >Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</org> of the American
                Medical association began to test all contraceptive products and
                to report thereon and two more state medical societies, <org
                    reg="Iowa Medical Society">Iowa</org> and <org
                    reg="Minnesota Medical Association">Minnesota</org>, passed
                resolutions favourable to Planned Parenthood as a medical and
                public health service.</p>
            <p>Copies of the manual, “<title>Techniques of Conception
                    Control</title>,” were requested from the federation by
                47,000 physicians throughout the country.</p>
            <p>Increasing emphasis on the positive phases on its program, the
                federation published and distributed a pamphlet, “<title>To
                    Those Denied a Child</title>” to assist childless couples in
                understanding the problem and knowing what medical facilities
                were available for treatment.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Education.–</head>
            <p>New technical manuals were published and copies were requested by
                21,000 nurses, 11,000 clergymen, 4,000 social workers and 1,300
                professors of sociology. Refresher courses for nurses were held
                in six states reaching some 1,000 nurses particularly in the
                public health field.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Research.–</head>
            <p>Research in chemical contraceptives was undertaken in two
                university laboratories. No new discoveries were made. Two
                awards of $500 were offered by the federation for scientists
                making the most significant contribution to research in
                contraception and the correction of sterility.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Social Work.–</head>
            <p>The federation retained a full-time social work consultant on its
                staff. <title>An Outline for a Course in Planned
                    Parenthood</title> by <person reg="Cannon, Mary Antoinette"
                    >Mary A. Cannon</person>, professor of social work,
                    <org>Columbia university</org>, <place reg="New York"
                    >N.Y.</place>, was published as a teaching guide for courses
                in schools of social work and colleges. The federation and many
                of its affiliated state leagues participated in the
                    <org>National and State Conferences of Social Work</org> and
                in institute programs on marriage and the family.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Negro Program.–</head>
            <p>A full-time consultant on work with Negroes was added to the
                staff, to co-ordinate work in this field. Assistance was given
                in 14 states and the <place
                    reg="District of Columbia, United States">District of
                    Columbia</place>. The <org>National Planning Committee on
                    Work with Negroes</org> was formed, held regular meetings,
                and issued two printed appeals for support and action. The
                    <org>National Medical association</org>, the <org>National
                    Negro Insurance association</org>, the <org>National Council
                    of Negro Women</org> and the <org>National Conference of
                    Colored Parent-Teachers</org> associations were among the
                national organizations affirming or reaffirming their support of
                the Planned Parenthood program.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Religious.–</head>
            <p>The <org>National Clergymen’s Advisory council</org>, with more
                than 1,000 members, was organized to carry on an active program;
                and officers, regional chairmen and an executive committee were
                elected by its members.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Press and Radio.–</head>
            <p>Articles appeared in 32 magazines, and more than 50 radio
                stations put the federation’s transcription of “<title>Freedom
                    from Fear</title>” on the air.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">State Organizations.–</head>
            <p>Five states and the District of Columbia added professional
                workers to their staffs and all were given orientation at
                national headquarters.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">International.–</head>
            <p>Other groups continued activities in <place>Great Britain</place>
                and <place>India</place>, but the war disrupted all other
                organized effort. A royal commission, to study population
                trends, was setup in <place>England</place>, where the birth
                rate was the highest in many years and the nation’s general
                health was the best in years in spite of the war. Population
                growth in the neutral countries of <place>Sweden</place>,
                    <place>Switzerland</place> and <place reg="Ireland"
                    >Eire</place> was reported. India’s population continued its
                increase and leaders there advocated birth control as partial
                answer to the problem. In other countries in
                    <place>Europe</place> birth rates were low, although
                    <place>Germany</place> alleged a rise, which, if true, might
                be due to the policy of stimulating illegitimacy. (For U.S.
                births, see CENSUS DATA, 1944.)</p>
            <p><place reg="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">Russia</place>
                adopted a new policy to stimulate its birth rate, including
                state aid to mothers of large families, with medals and
                honourary titles added.</p>
            <p><place>Canada</place> also adopted a “child allowance” policy, to
                cover all children from birth to 16 years. A substitute for the
                Beveridge plan was presented in Great Britain, which would
                provide compulsory insurance covering, among other things,
                maternity benefits and family allowances. The question of
                attempting to ban the sale of contraceptives, and thus stimulate
                the birth rate, was debated n parliament, but not adopted,
                because of vigorous opposition to such a policy. (See also BIRTH
                STATISTICS.)</p>
