        <div type="section">
            <p>At a national conference in <place reg="New York, New York">New York</place>
                sponsored by the <org>National Research council</org>’s <org
                    reg="National Research Council, Committee on Human Reproduction">Committee on
                    Human Reproduction</org>, two major problems were considered: (1) the urgent
                need to develop through research a simple, inexpensive and universally acceptable
                contraceptive and (2) the equally urgent need to build world-wide public acceptance
                of the necessity for family limitation and for use of contraceptive measures to
                reach this objective. Scientists themselves needed to be alerted to the need for
                research in the field of human reproduction; few of them in 1949 were qualified to
                carry on such research. The conference also discussed the problems of infertility;
                increased knowledge in this area might lead to discovery of new factors involved in
                fertility control.</p>
            <p>Birth control was officially adopted by <place>Japan</place> during the year. The new
                law was passed unanimously in the house of representatives and backed by a large
                    <org reg="Japan, House of Councillors">house of councillors</org> majority.
                According to a statement issued by the <org
                    reg="Japan, Ministry of Health and Welfare">Japanese Welfare ministry</org> “<q
                    who="JWM">an overwhelming majority of the Japanese people favour birth control
                    as a solution of health and population</q>.”</p>
            <p>The first meeting of the committee established by the 1948 <org>International
                    Congress on Population and World Resources in Relation to the Family</org> was
                held in <place reg="London, England">London</place>. It was attended by delegates
                from the Planned Parenthood organizations from the <place>United States</place>,
                    <place>Great Britain</place>, <place>Sweden</place> and the
                    <place>Netherlands</place>. They adopted as their name the <org>International
                    Committee on Planned Parenthood</org>.</p>

            <p>The fifth annual <org>Albert D. and Mary Lasker Foundation</org> Awards in Planned
                Parenthood went to <person reg="Cooper, George M.">George M. Cooper</person>, head
                of the <org
                    reg="North Carolina State Board of Health, Division of Preventative Medicine"
                    >Division of Preventative Medicine</org>, North Carolina State Board of Health,
                and to <person reg="Hartman, Carl Gottfried">Carl G. Hartman</person>, zoologist
                formerly with The <org>Johns Hopkins Medical school</org>. Cooper was honoured for
                his leadership in establishing birth control in 1937 in the public health service of
                    <place>North Carolina</place>, the first state to give this service through its
                public health departments. By 1949 the example had been followed by six other
                states. Hartman received his award for scientific research in the physiology and
                time of ovulation in women and the survival time of egg and sperm which brought
                nearer the solution of basic problems in the field of fertility and infertility.</p>

            <head type="sub">U.S. Goals.–</head>
            <p>The <org reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned Parenthood
                    federation</org>’s annual meeting devoted a major part of its discussion to
                program goals. The membership expressed its aim “<q who="PPFA">to further universal
                    acceptance of family planning as an essential element of responsible parenthood
                    and stable family life</q>,” this program to be accomplished through three main
                lines of activity–service, education and research. The inclusion of birth control
                services in public health clinics, hospitals and as an integral part of national
                health planning was considered a service goal with continued maintenance of the
                federation’s own services until availability of complete coverage for U.S. families.
                The provision of general an dprogessional education by the federation was recognized
                as the method for achieving this end.</p>
            <p>The Planned Parenthoood federation was in 1949 the national agency and clearinghouse
                for 15 state leagues and 131 local committees. Birth control clinics numbered 537.
                These services were in 229 public health departments, 48 hospitals, 227 extramural
                clinics and there were 33 referral services. Of the 92 infertility clinics reported
                to the federation, 25 were under Planned Parenthood auspices.</p>
