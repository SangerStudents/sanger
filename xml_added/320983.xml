        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <div type="section">
            <p>During 1951 the <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org> appointed <person
                    reg="Vogt, William">William Vogt</person>, conservationist and ecologist, as its
                national director. Prime Minister <person reg="Nehru, Jawaharlal">Jawaharlal
                    Nehru</person> of <place>India</place> during the year declared that birth
                control was essential to the national well-being of his country. His government
                implemented this policy by requesting assistance from the <org>World Health
                    organization</org> of the <org>United Nations</org> in initiating a population
                control program. <person reg="Stone, Abraham">Abraham Stone</person>, federation
                vice-president, was designated to make a pilot project in India under W.H.O.
                auspices and Indian government sponsorship. He worked through local health centres,
                with control groups of illiterates as well as educated Indians who were taught
                family control methods requiring no artificial appliances.</p>
            <p>The third meeting of the <org>International Committee on Planned Parenthood</org>
                took place in <place reg="London, England">London</place>, Eng., to plan a world
                conference on planned parenthood. Lady <person reg="Rama Rau, Dhanvanthi">Rama
                    Rau</person>, founder and president of the <org
                    reg="Family Planning Association of India">Indian Family Planning
                    Association</org>, invited the committee to hold its meeting in India in 1952
                under the association’s sponsorship, to facilitate the attendance of far easterners
                concerned with their countries’ pressing population problems.</p>

            <p>The seventh annual <org>Albert D. and Mary Lasker Foundation</org> Awards in Planned
                Parenthood went to two authorities on world population problems. They were William
                Vogt and <person reg="Burch, Guy Irving">Guy Irving Burch</person>. Vogt was cited
                for “<q who="LFA">his investigations in the field of conservation and his
                    achievement in bringing world population problems home to a vast number of
                    people</q>.” Burch, founder and director of the <org>Population Reference
                    bureau</org>, <place reg="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</place>, and
                coathor of <title>Human Breeding and Survival</title>, was recognized posthumously
                because “<q who="LFA">perhaps more than any other individual he was responsible for
                    today’s awareness of the population problem and the need for positive action to
                    resolve it</q>.”</p>

            <p>One of the serious gaps in the effort of make planned parenthood availale to families
                everywhere had been the lack of a simple, low-cost contraceptive that could be
                safely used by illiterate, poverty-stricken mothers in overcrowded parts of the
                world. In an effort to co-ordinate and promote the research required to discover
                such a contraceptive, the federation established the <org>Robert L. Dickinson
                    Research memorial</org> in 1951. The memorial, which was sponsoring basic
                research in the almost unexplored field of human reproduction, was established as
                the federation’s tribute to <person reg="Dickinson, Robert Latou"
                >Dickinson</person>, distinguished medical birth control pioneer. Four research
                projects were sponsored during the year by Dickinson memorial grants, as approved by
                the federation’s medical committee and the advisory committee of the memorial.</p>
            <p>Clinical and laboratory research in contraception and other phases of human fertility
                were also carried on during the year at the <org>Margaret Sanger Research
                    bureau</org> in <place reg="New York, NY">New York city</place>.</p>
            <p>The Planned Parenthood federation was in 1951 the national agency and clearinghouse
                for 12 state leagues and 100 local committees. Birth control clinics numbered 517.
                These services were in 274 public health departments, 48 hospitals, and 173
                extramural clinics, and there were 22 referral services. The seven states which
                included birth control in their public health programs were: <place>Alabama</place>,
                    <place>Florida</place>, <place>Georgia</place>, <place>Mississippi</place>,
                    <place>North Carolina</place>, <place>South Carolina</place>, and
                    <place>Virginia</place>. The known infertility clinics in the country were 66 of
                which 13 were under Planned Parenthood federation auspices.</p>
