            <p>Population increases, the result of marked and widespread lowering of death rates
                since 1932, were reported by the <org>United Nations</org> in a population summary
                during 1952. The year also marked increasing acceptance on an international level of
                the need to plan human birth in relation to available supplies of food and other
                vital resources.</p>

                method of birth control under auspices of the <org>Indian government</org> and <org>World

            <p>The first <org reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 3rd">World

                initiated by the <org>International Committee on Planned Parenthood</org> whose

                cultural factors in relation to population problems; to exchange information and
                views on planned parenthood programs in different countries; to stimulate social and
                biological research in human reproduction and to encourage the formation of national
                planned parenthood organizations. The conference, which was held under the auspices
                of the <org reg="Family Planning Association of India">Indian Family Planning
                    Association</org>, had <person reg="Rama Rau, Dhanvanthi">Lady Rama

            <head type="sub">Research.–</head>
            <p>The urgent need for simpler and less expensive methods of fertility control led to
                the federation’s establishment of the position of research director, and the
                appointment of <person reg="Henshaw, Paul Stewart">Paul Henshaw</person>, an
                experimental biologist, to the post, in order to expedite, co-ordinate, conduct and
                promote research in the field of fertility and sterility. Henshaw carried out a
                survey on the potentialities of the physiologic control of fertility, which revealed
                that the principle of such control could be regarded as established, based on the
                large amount of published literature in the field. The study also showed that two
                types of further research were needed: (1) practical studies to establish minimal
                doses, the most effective methods of treatment and the standardization of treatment
                materials at low cost; and (2) basic studies to develop still more suitable
                methods.</p>

            <p>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America was, in 1952, the national agency and
                clearing house for 11 state leagues and 91 local committees. Birth control clinics
                numbered 519. These services were in 274 public health departments, 48 hospitals and
                175 extramural clinics, and there were 22 referral services. Of the 196,604 yearly
                total of patients visiting birth control clinics in 1951, the majority, or 189,658,
                were served in extramural clinics sponsored by federation affiliates. The seven
                states which included birth control in their public health programs were
                    <place>Alabama</place>, <place>Florida</place>, <place>Georgia</place>,
                    <place>Mississippi</place>, <place>North Carolina</place>, <place>South
                    Carolina</place> and <place>Virginia</place>. The known infertility clinics in
                the country providing diagnosis and treatment of childless couples were 66, of which
                13 were under the auspices of the Planned Parenthood federation.</p>
