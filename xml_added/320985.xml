        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <div type="section">
            <p>Events converged to make fertility control programs increasingly needed and wanted in
                many parts of the world in 1954. A major cause was the continued disbalance between
                available resources and population growth, particularly in underdeveloped countries.
                This was underlined by an exhaustive <org reg="United Nations">UN</org> study,
                    “<title type="article">The Determinants and Consequences of Populations
                    Trends</title>” (May 1954) that predicted world numbers would rise from
                3,000,000,000 to 4,000,000,000 within 30 years, with little promise of a
                corresponding increase in the production of basic resources.</p>

            <p>Growing government interest in <place>Japan</place> in expanding national family
                planning efforts was evidenced by an invitation extended <person
                    reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, president, <org>International
                    Planned Parenthood Federation</org>, to testify before the <org
                    reg="Japan, House of Councillors Public Welfare Committee">Japanese diet’s upper
                    house welfare committee</org> (April 1954). The first foreign woman to appear
                before this body, the birth control pioneer’s guidance was enlisted on methods of
                accelerating the government program. Mrs. Sanger was also keynote speaker at the
                first national meeting of the <org>Japan Federation of Family Planning</org>.</p>
            <p>Priority to <place>India</place>’s overpopulation problem was given in that
                government’s census report (Nov. 1953). The <person reg="Gopalaswami, R.A.">census
                    commissioner</person> warned against a population of 520,000,000 by 1981;
                presented a study of all available methods of conception control; and urged that
                Indian parents voluntarily limit their families to three children in order to
                achieve a stationary population of 450,000,000 in 1969.</p>
            <p>The year 1954 marked the first <org reg="World Population Conference (Rome, 1954)"
                    >World Population conference</org> of experts under UN auspices. Instigated by
                the <org reg="United Nations Economic and Social Council">Economic and Social
                    council</org> of the UN, it took place at the <org
                    reg="United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture
                    organization</org> headquarters, <place reg="Rome, Italy">Rome, It.</place>,
                Aug. 31-Sept. 10, with a number of other leading international agencies
                collaborating. The conference had the co-operation of the Italian government, which
                also helped to finance the meeting. It was attended by experts nominated by
                governments, nongovernmental scientific organizations, interested specialized
                agencies and experts with scientific interest in population problems. The
                International Planned Parenthood federation was represented by two official
                observers invited by the UN, with ten of its leaders participating in the
                conference.</p>
            <p>In an effort to facilitate the use of birth control among peasant populations, a
                number of field tests in simple, low cost contraceptives were begun among villagers
                in India, <place>Ceylon</place> and <place>Pakistan</place> by <person

                    reg="United States">U.S.</place> medical authority in conception control.</p>
            <p>The <org>Family Planning Association of <place>Puerto Rico</place></org> was established (March
                1954) and launched a three-year campaign which included scientific studies in birth
                control, and a pilot project of mass education to increase public interest and draw
                patients to the existing 160 public health sponsored birth control clinics.</p>
            <p>U.S. visits of two outstanding Planned Parenthood leaders were sponsored by the
                    <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>. They were Lady <person

                Planned Parenthood federation, whose coast-to-coast lecture tour on “<title>India’s
                    Social Revolution</title>” served to broaden public understanding of family
                planning needs in an underdeveloped nation, and <person reg="Ottesen-Jensen, Elise">
                    >Elise Ottesen-Jensen</person>, Swedish birth control and sex education pioneer.
                Mrs. Ottensen-Jensen was the recipient of the 1954 <org>Lasker foundation</org>
                award in Planned Parenthood, presented for “<q who="LFA">setting
                        <place>Sweden</place>’s family planning movement in the forefront of

            <p>A colloquium on the social aspects of family planning and fertility control held at
                    <org>Columbia university</org>’s Arden house (1954) brought together for the
                first time experts in sociology, religion, psychiatry, law, anthropology,
                gynaecology, public health and demography, to assist the federation assess and
                investigate attitudes toward the practice of fertility control and its effect on
                other social and cultural problems.</p>

            <p>During 1954, the <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org> was the national
                clearing house for 12 state leagues and 101 local committees, in 29 states. Birth
                control clinics numbered 532. These services were in 279 public health clinics, 74
                hospitals and in 182 extramural clinics, sponsored by Planned Parenthood committees.
                Infertility referral services numbered 65. The seven states which included birth
