        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <p>Two events–one in the <place>United States</place> and one in
            <place>England</place>–highlighted the year 1958 for the family planning movement. In
                <place reg="New York, NY">New York city</place>, a longstanding prohibition on birth
            control services in municipal hospitals was reversed. And in England, the <org>Lambeth
                conference</org> of the bishops of the <org>Anglican (Protestant Episcopal)
                Communion</org> adopted a new statement vigorously endorsing family planning.</p>
        <p>In July the <person reg="Jacobs, Morris A.">hospital commissioner</person> of New York
            city ordered a doctor at a <org reg="Kings County Hospital">city hospital</org> not to
            prescribe a contraceptive for a Protestant patient whose life, the doctor believed,
            would be endangered by another pregnancy. This action drew widespread protests from the
            city’s Protestant and Jewish groups, as well as many civic and medical organizations; it
            was supported by the <org reg="Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York City">Roman
                Catholic Archdiocese</org>. After two months in which the issue was discussed
            prominently in the press, the <org reg="New York City Board of Hospitals">Board of
                Hospitals</org>, by an 8-2 vote, reversed the ban. The board, noting that the
            medical profession recognizes contraception as the proper therapeutic procedure when
            pregnancy is contraindicated, authorized municipal hospital staffs to provide this
            service in such situations. It also exempted from participation personnel who had
            religious objections to birth control. The new policy was subsequently extended to cover
            the medical services of the city’s welfare department.</p>
        <p>At the Lambeth conference the Episcopal bishops, representing 46 countries, characterized
            birth control as “<q who="LCBAC">a right and important factor in Christian family
                life</q>.” Responsibility “<q who="LCBAC">for deciding upon the number and frequency
                of children has been laid by God upon the consciences of parents everywhere</q>,”
            the bishops stated. “<q who="LCBAC">The procreation of children is not the sole purpose
                of Christian marriage. Implicit within the bond between husband and wife is the
                relationship of love with its sacramental expression in physical union</q>.”</p>
        <p>Further progress was made in the world-wide effort to discover simpler, more effective
            means of controlling fertility. Clinical tests continued in <place>Puerto Rico</place>,
            the U.S. and elsewhere of a new oral contraceptive pill–a steroid device–while basic
            research was initiated into other aspects of the reproductive system.</p>
        <p>Interest in family planning in the <place>Soviet Union</place> was indicated by an
            official invitation to <person reg="Stone, Abraham">Abraham Stone</person>,
            vice-president of the <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>, to address
            the <org
                reg="National Conference
                        of Gynecologists and Obstetricians, 10th"
                >10th National Conference of Gynecologists and Obstetricians</org> in <place
                reg="Moscow, Soviet Union">Moscow</place>. Stone reported that physicians from all
            parts of the Soviet Union were eager to obtain specific information on modern birth
            control techniques, products and research activities in western countries.</p>
        <p>In its annual report, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America noted that during 1957
            more than 250,000 visits were made to centres operated by the federation’s 103 state and
            local affiliates by women seeking contraceptive service, infertility treatment and
            marriage education. At the federation’s annual meeting in November, the Albert and Mary
            Lasker Award in Planned Parenthood was given to <person reg="Brown, Harrison">Harrison
                Brown</person> of the <org>California Institute of Technology</org> for his
            pioneering work on the relationship between population growth and future needs for
            resources <supplied resp="MSPP">...</supplied> his educational activity among scientists
            and laymen on <supplied resp="MSPP">the</supplied> need for world-wide family planning
            to achieve and maintain global resource population balance. The <org>International
                Planned Parenthood federation</org> held a western hemisphere regional conference in
                <place>Jamaica</place>, <place reg="British West Indies">B.W.I.</place>, in <gap
                reason="faulty reproduction" extent="one word"/> and heard a forthright statement of

                federation</place>. Similar emphasis on <supplied resp="MSPP">the</supplied> need
