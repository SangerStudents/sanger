        <p>In the death of Clinton Chance I have lost not only a close friend but an invaluable
            adviser and co-worker in the cause of planned parenthood.</p>
        <p>Back in 1920, on one of my annual visits to <place reg="London, England">London</place>,
            Clinton was taking a psychological view of the future possibilities of planned
            parenthood movement. He was a keen observer of character and believed in giving support
            not only to ideals but to action. In our final summing-up of activities and dreams of
            conquests he said “<q who="CHACL">Let me know when there is an important joh to do and
                money needed for it</q>”. </p>
        <p>A few months later the decision of the <org reg="New York State Appellate Court"
                >Appellate Court of <place>New York</place></org> was given that doctors could give
            contraceptive advice to patients. I cabled Clinton that I could get a <personRef
                reg="Bocker, Dorothy">woman doctor</personRef> to open a Birth Control Clinic but
            that five thousand dollars was needed for her salary and the clinic set-up for the first
            year -- was he interested? The cable in reply said “<q who="CHACL">Go ahead. Cheque
                follows</q>”. That was the first legal clinic under medical supervision to be opened
            in the <place reg="United States">U.S.A.</place> and from it sprang some 600 clinics. </p>
        <p>Clinton was too modest to take credit for the important part he had played in the planned
            parenthood movement. His left hand did not know what his right hand gave out. </p>
        <p>It is good to have indelible memories of a man like Clinton Chance, of his honest
            forthright opinions, of his vision and loyalty and truth, of his wit and laughter in the
            midst of turmoil. He was a man, a friend, I am proud to have known. </p>
