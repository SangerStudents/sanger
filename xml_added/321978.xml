		<head>BIRTH CONTROL FOR HEALTHY HAPPY MOTHERS</head>
		<q who="APC">
			<p> Healthier mothers, better cared for children, and happier marriages are benefits
				that would accrue from a universal knowledge of birth control, according to Dr.
					<person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>. </p>
		</q>
		<p> “The idea of birth control coming to the poverty-stricken mother is the most important
			factor in her over-worked life. When her babies come too close together in the years of
			her young motherhood, she is not able to get her full strength. </p>
		<p> “She cannot give them the proper care and attention her heart longs to give. </p>
		<p> “If she has three years at least between the births of children, life will be different
			for her and her babies. She should be well and strong and normal psychologically-- fully
			recovered from the train of bearing one child before she has another. </p>
		<p> “Finances also should be considered before the family is increased. There should be
			money enough in the bank to carry them all through any emergency that might occur .</p>
		<p> “Increasing the family should be a voluntary thing because the children that arrive that
			way are wanted children for whom preparation has been made and for whom the family
			budget and family health provide.”</p>
