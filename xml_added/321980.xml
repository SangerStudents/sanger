        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <div type="section">
            <p>During 1950 the Planned Parenthood movement began a long-range education, service and
                research program. This program, adopted the previous year by the <org>Planned
                    Parenthood Federation of America</org> was: “<q who="PPFA">To provide leadership
                    toward universal acceptance of family planning as an essential element of
                    responsible parenthood and stable family life</q>.” Intensified field work was
                carried on, especially on the Pacific coast. A program of work with minority-group
                families whose economic status denied them private medical care was expanded to
                educate them as to contraceptive clinic services available. Work was carried on with
                ten leading Negro organizations with the objective of encouraging their leaders to
                co-operate with national, state and local Planned Parenthood programs and to
                stimulate their interest in this health measure. Consultants also took part in
                courses or in family institutes under federation sponsorship in 23 Negro colleges as
                a method of interpreting the program to students who would one day take their places
                as community leaders.</p>
            <p>The federation produced its first film <title type="film">A Planned Parenthood
                    Story</title>, designed to reach married couples in need of accurate information
                on how conception control could strengthen their family life.</p>

            <p>The sixth annual <org>Albert D. and Mary Lasker Foundation Awards</org> in Planned
                Parenthood went to <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, founder
                of the birth control movement and <person reg="Moses, Bessie Louise">Bessie L.
                    Moses</person>, M.D., of <place reg="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore</place>.
                Mrs. Sanger’s citation read: “<q who="AMLF">To Margaret Sanger, foremost in teaching
                    families wise planning in birth control: Leader in influencing nations towards
                    balanced population; living to see her beginnings in city slums grow into plans
                    for a planet</q>.” Dr. Moses, obstetrician and instructor in obstetrics,
                    <org>Johns Hopkins university</org>, was recognized for “her brilliant record of
                forwarding the cause of Planned Parenthood among the public and medical
                profession.”</p>

            <p>During the year the federation established its own research program in human
                reproduction and three studies in fertility and infertility were carried over from a
                previous research project that had been sponsored with the <org
                    reg="National Research Council, Committee on Human Reproduction">National
                    Research council’s Committee on Human Reproduction</org> and the <org>National
                    Committee on Maternal Health</org>.</p>
            <p>The final goal of research in this field was to develop a contraceptive method
                sufficiently simple, safe and effective to be used by families living in
                overpopulated world areas where existing methods cannot be widely disseminated
                because cost and complexity prohibit their use among illiterate submerged
                peoples.</p>
            <p>Clinical and laboratory research in contraception and other phases of human fertility
                were also carried on during the year at the <org>Margaret Sanger Research
                    bureau</org>.</p>
            <p>The Planned Parenthood federation was in 1950 the national agency and clearinghouse
                for 15 state leagues and 98 local committees. Birth control clinics numbered 522.
                These services were in 252 public health departments, 52 hospitals and 190
                extramural clinics and there were 28 referral services. Of the 162,377 yearly total
                of patients visiting birth control clinics in 1949, the majority or 150,693 were
                served in the extramural clinics, sponsored by federation affiliates. Of the 67
                infertility clinics, 16 were under Planned Parenthood auspices.</p>
