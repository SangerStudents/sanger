        <head>Birth Control</head>
        <div type="section">
            <p>The first comprehensive program on research in human reproduction was begun during
                1948. Nine studies were started on factors governing fertility control and problems
                of infertility in as many institutions throughout the country. They were recommended
                by the <org reg="National Research Council, Committee on Human Reproduction"
                    >National Research Councils Committee on Human Reproduction</org> to the board
                of the <org>National Committee on Maternal Health</org>; funds were raised mainly by
                the <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>, one of the three
                collaborating organizations. The dearth of scientific work in fertility control
                resulted in numerous applications for study of fields other than conception
                control.</p>

            <p>The <org>International Congress on Population and World Resources in Relation to the
                    Family</org>, held in <place reg="Cheltenham, England">Cheltenham</place>,
                England, was an indication of the rising interest among scientists and the lay
                public in world population problems. <person reg="Orr, John Boyd">Sir John
                    Orr</person>, former director of the <org
                    reg="United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization">World Food and
                    Agricultural organization</org> told the congress, “<q who="ORRJO">If we cannot
                        <supplied resp="MSPP">solve</supplied> the problem of world resources in
                    this century, we are heading for the greatest catastrophe in history...hungry
                    people do not die quietly, and why should they?</q>” Representatives from more
                than 20 countries participated. They were leaders in three fields: scientific and
                social inquiry, biological and medical research, and organizational activity in the
                promotion of planned parenthood. A provisional international committee was
                established with headquarters in <place reg="London, England">London</place>. Its
                purpose was “<q who="ICPP">to promote research and education for the furthering of
                    human welfare through planned parenthood and progressive sex education</q>.”
                Members were the national Planned Parenthood organizations of <place><org
                        reg="Family Planning Association">Great Britain</org></place>, the
                        <place><org reg="Nederlandse Vereniging voor Sexuele Hervorming"

                and the <place>United States</place>, the only four nations where such agencies
                existed.</p>

            <head type="sub">Magazine Poll.–</head>
            <p>A poll of more than 3,000,000 women was conducted by <title type="journal">Woman’s
                    Home Companion</title>. Three-fifths favoured making birth-control information
                available to all adults, and 97% of those polls approved birth control measures for
                use by married women.</p>

            <head type="sub">Committee on Clinic Studies.–</head>
            <p>A demonstration to evaluate the practical efficiency of simple existing contraceptive
                methods was developed in order to broaden the use of conception control in public
                health. The need for such a study was indicated by the small percentage
                (approximately 5%) of patients attending pre- and postnatal public health clinics
                receiving conception-control information.</p>
            <p>It was found after an investigation by <person reg="Kling, Llewellyn E.">L. E.
                    Kling</person>, federation medical director, of clinics in
                    <place>Florida</place>, <place>Mississippi</place>, <place reg="North Carolina"
                    >North</place> and <place>South Carolina</place>, <place>Virginia</place>,
                    <place>West Virginia</place>, <place>Georgia</place> and <place>Alabama</place>
                that staffs were too overworked to give time to fitting and instructing patients,
                Many patients did not know this service was available, since neither the public
                health nurse nor health educator mentioned or encouraged it.</p>
            <p>A committee on clinic studies was appointed by the federation’s <org
                    reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Medical Advisory Committee"
                    >Medical Executive committee</org>. It was given the support of private
                physicians who agreed on the need to encourage practical application of planned
                parenthood in public health.</p>

            <head type="sub"><place>Massachusetts</place> Birth-Control Referendum.–</head>
            <p>A birth control referendum on the question of allowing physicians to prescribe
                contraceptives to married women whose health of life, in the judgment of the
                physician, required it, was defeated by 200,000 votes in the Massachusetts
                election.</p>
            <p>The measure, which aimed to place contraceptive advice in the hands of the medical
                profession, was endorsed by a majority of resident members of the <org>Massachusetts
                    Medical society</org> and by more than 1,000 Protestant and Jewish clergymen.
                Four thousand voters in 300 local committees campaigned to repeal the state law.</p>

            <head type="sub">Organization.–</head>
            <p>The Planned Parenthood federation was in 1948 the national agency and clearinghouse
                for 15 state leagues and 166 local committees. The total number of birth control
                clinics stood at 557. These services were in 242 public health clinics, 62 hospital
                clinics, 210 extramural clinics and 43 referral services. Of the 58 fertility
                clinics in the U.S. listed with the federation, 13 were under Planned Parenthood
                direction.</p>
