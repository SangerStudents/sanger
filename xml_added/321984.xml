        <head>Birth Control.</head>
        <div type="section">
            <p>The planning of family size as a basic means of alleviating family welfare problem,
                overcrowding and poverty, with their resulting local and international tensions,
                gained acceptance in many parts of the world during the latter part of 1952 and in
                1953.</p>

            <head type="sub">International.–</head>
            <p>An outstanding achievement was the establishment of the first global organization,
                the <org>International Planned Parenthood federation.</org> It was formed at the
                    <org reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 3rd">third
                    International Planned Parenthood conference</org>, held in <place>Bombay,
                    India</place>, in Nov. 1952, the first meeting of its kind to be held in the
                    <place>far east</place>.</p>
            <p>When the <org reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 4th">fourth
                    International Planned Parenthood conference</org> took place in <place
                    reg="Stockholm, Sweden">Stockholm, Swed</place>., in Aug. 1953, the agency was
                formally ratified and officers were elected.<person reg="Sanger, Margaret"> Margaret
                    Sanger</person>, founder of the birth control movement and honorary president of
                the <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>, was designated president;
                Lady <person reg="Rama Rau, Dhanvanthi">Rama Rau</person>, founder and president of
                the <org>Family Planning Association of India</org>, was elected chairman. The aims
                of the new international body were set forth: to bring about the universal
                acceptance of planned parenthood in the interests of family welfare, social
                well-being and international good will by means of a program devoted to education,
                service and research. The federation’s membership comprised planned parenthood
                organizations in <place>Great Britain</place>, India, Sweden, the
                    <place>Netherlands</place>, the <place>United States</place>, <place>Hong
                    Kong</place>, <place>Singapore</place>, and <place>west Germany</place>.</p>
            <p>Still another major event was the inclusion of a family planning program in the
                Indian government’s first five-year plan. Presented to both houses of Parliament by
                Prime Minister <person reg="Nehru, Jawaharlal">Jawaharlal Nehru</person>, the
                program which was adopted was provided with a budget of $1,300,000 to carry hour
                family planning services in government hospitals and public health agencies. In
                addition, its aim was to make intensive studies in motivation regarding family
                planning and to carry on field experiment in different methods of fertility control,
                as well as medical and technical research in this area.</p>
            <p>Late in 1953 Lady Rama Rau embarked on a coast-to-coast lecture tour of the
                    <place>United States</place>, speaking on “<title type="article">India’s Social
                    Revolution</title>.” The tour was under the auspices of the Planned Parenthood
                federation. The lectures in 35 cities, with considerable corollary publicity in
                newspapers, magazines and on radio and television, were expected to broaden greatly
                American understanding of family planning as related to India’s pressing population
                problems.</p>
            <p>Asian concern and growing leadership in the population field were further evidenced
                by the sponsorship of a Japanese tour for Mrs. Sanger by the <org
                    reg="Mainichi Press">Mainichi newspapers</org> of <place reg="Tokyo, Japan"
                    >Tokyo</place>. The invitation, which was signed by 3,000 Japanese, brought the
                birth control pioneer to Japan in Oct. 1952, where, by means of public meetings,
                broadcasts and panel discussions with experts, she helped encourage, according to
                the <person reg="Unidentified">vice-minister of welfare</person>, “<q who="UNK">the
                    Japanese Government’s campaign to control conception by legal means</q>.”</p>

            <p>The urgent need to balance the dwindling world resources and the expanding human
                population focused scientific and public attention on research efforts to develop a
                simple, safe and low-cost means of fertility control. Interest during the year 1953
                centered about physiological means of control by pills, teas or inoculations.
                Reports issued described the use of chemical agents for control of fertility in
                animals and human beings. Certain naturally occurring and certain synthesized
                products were found effective. Fertility control problems not yet fully resolved
                were toxicity, large-scale production and cost.</p>

            <p>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America was during 1953 the national
                clearinghouse for 12 state leagues and 120 local committees. Birth control clinics
                numbered 519. These services were in 274 public health departments, 48 hospitals and
                175 clinics sponsored by federation affiliates. There were 22 referral services. The
                seven states which included birth control in their public health services were
                    <place>Alabama</place>, <place>Florida</place>, <place>Georgia</place>, <place>
                    Mississippi</place>, <place>North Carolina</place>, <place>South
                    Carolina</place> and <place>Virginia</place>. The known infertility clinics were
                74, of which 12 were under federation auspices.</p>
