        <head>MRS. SANGER'S TALK GETS BY POLICE CENSORS</head>


        <p/>
        <p>"Birth control does not mean race suicide," declared <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger,</person> head of the <org reg="American Birth Control League">Birth Control league</org> in an address
            yesterday afternoon before an audience in <org>California hall.</org> "Scientific
            birth control has already operated in a number of countries such as
                <place reg="Netherlands">Holland,</place>
            <place>New Zealand</place> and others, for sufficient time to demonstrate that instead
            of race suicide the percentage of infant survivals has been greatly increased with a
            better type and class of manhood and no decrease in population."</p>
        <q who="SFC"><p>The speaker traced the history of birth control, maintaining that it was not
                a new idea. She said it was, in fact, one of nature's fundamental laws, as in the
                natural course of events, without the interference of science, nature will weed out
                the sick, the old and feeble and the diseased to make room for the strong and
                healthy.</p>
            <p><div type="section">
                    <head type="sub">Describes Two Groups</head>
                </div></p>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger declared that the human race has divided broadly into two classes, the
                large family group and the small family group. She insisted that in the latter group
                are to be found culture, leisure, wealth and two or three children, who are brought
                up under the best conditions, sent to universities and given every advantage in
                life. In the large family group, according to the speaker, are found poverty,
                misery, the tenement life, infant and maternal mortality and the breeding places of
                all today's vital sociological problems.</p></q>
        <p>"Yet it is from the former group that the greatest clamor comes against giving to the
            latter group the information which allows the small family group to be what it is," said
            the speaker.</p>
        <p><div type="section">
                <head type="sub">Defends Birth Control</head>
            </div></p>
        <p>"Not only do we want to protect society from further propagation of the sick and insane,"
            said Mrs. Sanger, "but we want to make motherhood a conscious and voluntary act, giving
            her a chance to develop her own individuality and that of her children.</p>
        <p>You have been told that birth control is against the laws of <name type="deity"
                >God.</name> I say to you that if you, as an individual, believe in God as a
            divine intelligence who has endowed you with the power to think and to reason, then you
            certainly are at liberty to apply that intelligence according to the dictates of your
            conscience.</p>
        <p>Every advance in science has been attacked in this same manner. It is against the laws of
            nature for a man to shave, to cut his hair, to walk on two legs, instead of four, to
            ride in street cars or to submit an operation to save a life, just as much as it is
            against those laws for him to practice birth control," said the speaker.</p>
        <p><div type="section">
                <head type="sub">Wants Scientific Clinics</head>
            </div></p>
        <p>"What we need at present is scientific clinics at which the fundamentals of birth control
            can be taught. We should get away from the back-yard gossip and through the clinic bring
            to the poor woman who cannot afford to pay for it under the present conditions the same
            information that the rich woman gets today."</p>
        <q who="SFC"><p>The speaker denied that birth control would result in race suicide. She
                maintained that the maternal instinct is so great in women that they will perform
                the sacred duty of bearing and rearing children, but that with control an
                established fact the work will be done under conditions which are best for mother
                and child.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger told of being excluded from <place>Japan,</place> but expressed the hope
                that this bar would eventually be lifted. She emphasized the need of the doctrine in
                Japan, saying:</p></q>
        <p>"When the pressure of population gets too great in any country there can be but two ways
            of relief. One is war, with its attendant loss of life and possible increase in
            territory in the case of the victor and the other is through scientific birth control.
            Of the two, I believe that the latter is by far the better way."</p>
        <p><div type="section">
                <head type="sub">Will Go to England</head>
            </div></p>
        <q who="SFC"><p>The speaker said that she will continue her journey to the
                    <place reg="Asia">Orient</place>, lecturing in <place>China</place> and
                    <place>India,</place> and going on to <place>England,</place> where she will
                attend an <org reg="Fifth International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Clinic">international conference on birth control.</org></p></q>
        <p><person reg="Parton, Mary">Mrs. Mary Parton</person> acted as chairman of the meeting,
            introducing the speaker. During the questioning which followed the regular lecture a
            woman in the audience asked, <q who="UNK">"Is there any book now published which gives inside
            information on birth control"</q></p>
        <q><p>Mrs. Sanger smiled and nodding toward the door of the hall answered, </p></q> <p>"There are two
            policemen standing at the door who would be very glad to know the answer to that
            question."</p>
        <q who="SFC"><p>A detail of plain clothes officers was present at the meeting. <person
                    reg="Eisenhart, Katherine">Mrs. Katherine Eisenhart</person> was a member of the
                detail. No action was taken by the officers to stop the lecture or to prevent the
                distribution of pamphlets, which were given out at the door.</p></q>
