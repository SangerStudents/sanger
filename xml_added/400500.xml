        <p>I regret exceedingly that I am not allowed to speak to you this afternoon upon the
            subject of birth control. Why this privilege has been denied me I do not know for I have
            addressed audiences on the subject of birth control in nearly every country in
                <place>Europe</place> and every large city in the <place>United States</place>.
            However, I am grateful and pleased that I have been able to gain the permission to
            address you on the subject of War and Population. Inasmuch as I was unprepared to speak
            upon this subject, I ask your tolerance in allowing me to use my notes in addressing
            you.</p>
        <p>For more than a hundred years Europe had about doubled her population while the increase
            of her food supply was less than 5 percent. She had been piling up huge debts for future
            generations to pay. She had piled up such conditions as slums, unemployment, child
            labor, inertness, inefficiency, dependency, and finally, War. The World War, which
            started in Europe in 1914, was only a natural result of the manifold conditions which
            made such a volcanic eruption inevitable.</p>
        <p>During the past fifty years there was a tendency in every country in Europe to increase
            her numbers overwhelmingly in one group and to decrease her numbers in another section.
            The individuals in the latter group were those who did not let nature control their
            destinies. They had mastered the force of fecundity. In this group, whose numbers
            increase but slowly, there is among them the most progressive and advanced conditions.
            The other group, who are at the mercy of the urge of generation, are those who have
            increased not only their numbers but have increased their problems beyond the means of
            the development of the social conscience or the intelligence of the nation. In this
            group in every country in Europe is found the great problems both social and economic
            with which the world was confronted in 1914.</p>
        <p>In some countries, as in <place>England</place>, it was possible through colonization to
            alleviate the conditions in this group somewhat by sending her surplus population to
                <place>Canada</place>, <place>Australia</place> and other parts of the globe.</p>
        <p><place>France</place>, on the other hand, had kept her numbers more or less stationary
            and had aimed to develop quality in her people. It was to France that we turned for
            culture, for science, for advancement in almost every line of scientific thought.</p>
        <p> Germany, on the other hand, was the central country in Europe who though in some
            departments far more advanced than any other country in Europe, was by the nature of
            that particular advancement blocked in her progress--and her conditions at home made
            more complex and chaotic. Germany had been the first country in Europe to bring into her
            country the largest sources of alleviation for her population.</p>
        <p> During the dark and middle ages, <place>Germany</place> had relied upon infant
            mortality, disease and pestilence to keep her population within bounds. It was quite a
            natural event for a family during that period to have from 15 to 20 members, but for
            only one or two or at the most 4 in that group to survive to full maturity. This was the
            course which Nature had taken to lessen the possibility of war and to keep nations
            somewhat at peace with each other.</p>
        <p>With the advance of humanitarian thought, scientific and preventive medicine, Germany
            began to increase her problems. The urge for expansion on the part of the increasing
            population in any country when brought against geographical barriers acts blindly in the
            direction of conflict--whether in colonial rivalry or territorial swarming. The
            opportunities for Germany’s expansion were strictly limited by other powers and the
            prosperity due to the opening of new countries had long passed its maximum.</p>
        <p> The possibilities for expansion that were open a century ago, were fairly well exhausted
            and Germany found herself with serious problems on her hands which meant national
            expansion or ultimate stagnation. We find then a situation in Germany to be a rapidly
            increasing population, bringing this population largely to full maturity at a great
            expense to the government, through social service, old age pensions, and maternity
            benefits. The necessities for maintaining this population were out of her reach and made
            her dependant upon other countries for her population’s subsistence. There was a
            tendency too, toward a surplus of highly trained professional and technical men.</p>
        <p> The elaborate educational system of Germany was producing more engineers, surveyors,
            electrical engineers, industrial chemists and experts along various lines than the
            nation’s employers could utilize or absorb. The result was that such men had to be
            content to remain for a less wage than the unskilled workingmen could procure or to
            emigrate into foreign lands where that skill and inventiveness became the assets of
            other countries at Germany’s cost.</p>
        <p> While Germany’s birth rate was on the decline, in 1900 it was 36.5 percent, in 1909, 32
            percent, and in 1913 29.5 percent--the number of deaths diminished also by such
            proportion that her survivals became higher, and her population increased in a faster
            proportion than it did with an increasing birth rate. There was an increase of from
            700,000 to 800,000 souls a year which amounted to nearly four millions of new
            individuals every five years. It was upon such conditions, briefly and fragmentary as
            they are related here that Germany based her claim to a place in the sun and the right
            of livelihood of her surplus population.</p>
        <p> The <title type="journal">Berliner Post</title> in 1913 said: ‘<q who="BP">Can a great
                and rapidly growing nation like Germany always renounce all claims to further
                development or to the expansion of its political power? The final settlement with
                France and England, the expansion of our colonial possessions in order to create new
                German homes for the overflow of our population. . . .these are the problems which
                must be faced in the near future.</q>’</p>
        <p> If one studies the comments of the press during the five years preceding the Great War,
            it will be found in every instance that the argument upon which the need of the right of
            any country to prepare for war was based upon her increasing and growing population.</p>
        <p> Germany in 1910 had a population of 70,000,000. At the rate she was increasing she was
            bound to have in a short time double that number. It was the argument of her militarists
            and others who were seeking greater demands for Germany that she must find an outlet for
            her people, that Germany was hungry for trade, that she needed colonies, that she could
            not confine her growing population within her narrow geographical boundaries and in one
            of the magazines the <person reg="Wilhelm II">Kaiser</person> was quoted to have said
            that in 1950 Germany would possess a population of two hundred millions or something
            near to it.</p>
        <p> It might have been supposed that councils such as those representing the best ranks of
            thinking Germans might have been adverse to this condition of things, but extraordinary,
            as it may seem to all thinking people, the Marxian philosophy had taken a strong hold
            upon the people of Germany and particularly the working people of Germany during the
            past 25 years and inculcated the view point that the greater the numbers of the
            proletariat the higher would be their wages, the higher their demand in the labor market
            and the larger the numbers in the ranks of their revolutionists. So that up to the time
            of 1914 there was every tendency on the part of the thinkers of Germany both economic,
            social and political to increase their numbers and to trust to the gods the results,
            that might makes right. This, briefly, is the pivotal condition of the cause of the war
            in Europe in 1914. We all know the results and the consequences, but none of us can
            foretell the terrific decadent consequence which Germany is yet to feel. Her best fitted
            manhood was slaughtered in the war, her mothers and children left at home in a condition
            of physical starvation from which has come the generations of the future. When I was in
            Germany in 1920 and witnessed more than 10,000 little starving infants, the results of
            the blockade and the war, I felt that it would be far kinder for Germany’s future and
            for the future peace of the world to humanitarily allow these little victims to pass
            away rather than to keep them alive upon the charity of the enemy nations. More than 45
            percent of the women of Germany were made permanently sterile owing to the lack of food
            and the proper nourishment for child-bearing.</p>
        <p> The present circumstances in Germany are extremely heavy taxes, low value of money, the
            deficiency of labor in many establishments, with food and the cost of living so dear
            that the average wage earner lives upon a ration which means partial starvation.</p>
        <p> The conclusions to be drawn from Germany are that a nation will not be the victor in
            war; that war is no longer the way to settle international disputes, but until all
            nations recognize that there are fundamental dynamic forces at work which must be
            controlled, forces such as hunger and propagation, that we cannot solve one without
            including the other, that until these forces are recognized and acted upon wisely, the
            idea of international peace will remain a dream and a myth. Japan has problems today
            increasingly as great as those of Germany in 1910. She has a right to have those
            problems solved in a rational humanitarian way, but until our diplomats and statesmen
            recognize the causes of war and make the study of the population in all its manifold
            departments, all our <org reg="League of Nations">Leagues of Nations</org>,
            international conferences, agreements and international treaties will become the
            proverbial ‘scraps of paper.’</p>
        <p> Men and women of <place>Japan</place>, I appeal to you to look into this subject
            thoroughly. The mothers and women in your country are just as desirous of wiping out
            poverty, misery, suffering and war as the mothers and women of the other nations of the
            world. I appeal to you to set your motherhood free! To make your women something more
            than breeding machines such as the women of every nation have been during one period of
            that nation’s development. The time has come for international brotherhood and
            international emancipation.</p>
        <p> The advancement of hygiene and sanitation and welfare work in any country only increases
            its population problem which means invasion through immigration or armed invasion. Each
            nation must control her populations to the point where it will not be necessary to make
            aggression upon their neighbors.</p>
        <p> The study of the population problem will reveal to you the initial cause of the
            suffering of mankind, it will reveal the cause for his struggles and divisions into
            factions and parties. It will point out the remedy to obviate these differences and to
            establish a new order of civilization.</p>
        <p> To the working man it will show that the state of oppression and tyranny can exist only
            as a result of his ignorance. That the struggle between classes, capital and labor, the
            war between nations are the inevitable consequences of that ignorance.</p>
        <p> That the working man has himself been the producer of these conditions through his
            unlimited procreative powers--unchecked uncontrolled. While he and his brother are the
            initial sufferers from all the flagrant inequalities found in all nations today.</p>
        <p>Let us then friends, depart from the old methods of quantity and turn our attention to
            producing quality in our peoples.</p>
        <p>It will then be possible for everyone to have independence, personal dignity, motherhood
            will be glorified--and a nation may well expect to promote to its populations peace,
            justice, happiness and the International Brotherhood of the World.</p>
