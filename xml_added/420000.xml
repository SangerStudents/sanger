        <p>Courtesy, loyalty to employer, speed, punctuality are <gap reason="missing"
                extent="one word"/> virtues encouraged among the girls in the continuation classes
            of the <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> public schools by Mrs. <person
                reg="Wilcox, Anne H.">Anne H. Wilcox</person>, the supervisor. When she heard some
            of the girls "unpleasantly discussing their employers," Mrs. Wilcox decided they must be
            taught loyalty. She herself, beside received a good salary from the <org

                <org>Bloomingdale's</org>, the great department store of the upper East Side, where
            she is the "Welfare head." The "Welfare head" in these department stores are specially
            employed for the purpose of defeating organization among the shopgirls and to prevent
            strikes. "<q who="WILAN">Altogether too much is done for the girls in the department
                stores,</q>" this treacherous female testified recently, entering upon a eulogy of
            the owner of New York department stores. Curiously enough she failed to mention <person
                reg="Siegel, Henry">Siegel</person> and <person reg="Vogel, Frank E.">Vogel</person>
            as benefactors of this type.</p>
