        <head>Sex Talks</head>
        <p>Everywhere we hear our respectable friends say, in turning from us, "<q who="UNK">Oh, all
                this sex talk; it's disgusting</q>" Now, let us dwell on this a minute and see. In
            the first place, has there been any real sex talk? Do the girls or boys know very much
            more about themselves--their bodies or their sexual nature than they did ten years
            ago? Or has it been the education of the white slave agitation which has constituted
            mainly all the sex education that the average boy or girl has received. </p>
        <p>I believe this to be true, for if the same amount of space had been devoted to clean,
            scientific knowledge of the girls' and boys' own sex nature and their bodies, there
            would have been given to the reader such armour as the "grape juice procurer" could not
            penetrate. </p>
        <p>But no, the prudish conventionally minded person thinks that open, free discussion of the
            sex problem is to be regarded as a stigma of degeneration, whereas to thinking liberal
            minded people it is an indication of an earnest desire for a new conception of the
            sexual relation between man and woman. </p>
