        <head>IS THIS TRUE?</head>
        <p>A white goods manufacturer a few days ago told me that his object was to fill his shop
            with American girls. "<q who="UNK">I don't care if I do have to pay a few cents more; it
                pays in the end. An American girl is the last one out on strike and the first one
                back. No talking back, no impudence and fooling--she's a hustler--easily satisfied.
                It's these devilish foreigners who start the trouble, and there is no reasoning with
                them--they act like a pack of wolves. Yes, indeed, I'll fill my shop with American
                hands and have peace!</q>"</p>
        <p>Then he related the incident of the famous White Goods Strike and spoke of his girls
            going out like a lot of crazy, unreasonable creatures, excepting the American girls, who
            came to him and apologized that they had to strike, for they were afraid of their lives
            if they did not.</p>
        <p>This is serious comment, and food for thought. Will some American girls speak up and
            enlighten us?</p>
