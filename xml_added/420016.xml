        <head>THE OLD AND THE NEW</head>
        <p><org>Blackwell's Island</org> reveals two striking illustrations of the woman of the past
            and the woman of the future.</p>
        <p><person reg="Davis, Katharine Bement">Katharine B. Davis</person> is the woman of the
            past and <person reg="Edelsohn, Rebecca">Rebecca Edelsohn</person> is the woman of the
            future.</p>
        <p>Katharine B. Davis was carefully trained in her youth for college; her college training
            helped and fortified her to become Police Matron of <org><place reg="Bedford Hills, NY"
                    >Bedford </place>Reformatory for Women</org>, and subsequently Commissioner of
            Corrections of <place>New York</place>. Both worthy offices to uphold the present
            system.</p>
        <p>Katharine is a staunch defender of the present society, despite her experiences among
            "the fallen" and her knowledge that poverty and destitution has driven them to
            prostitution.</p>
        <p>Becky on the other hand comes from that race of people whose spirit has refused to be
            enslaved.</p>
        <p>Becky has never been to college but she knows more about existing conditions and their
            causes, about poverty, prostitution and their causes than Katharine learned in all her
            arduous years of college education. Becky considers such an calling as Police Matron as
            base and looks upon it with contemptuous scorn.</p>
        <p>Her ideals of womanhood are high. Her service to womankind is to free them.</p>
        <p>Katharine's position is to keep women in bondage. Becky's idea is to free all
            womankind.</p>
        <p>Katharine aims to keep women tame in submission to the chains of the present slavery.</p>
        <p>Becky aims to inspire them with revolt against the chains and the system which has
            enslaved them.</p>
        <p>In the background of these two women stands two greater forces which is a question of
            time when they too shall be in the death struggle similar to that taking place on <org
                reg="Blackwell's Island Penitentiary">Blackwell's Island</org>, Capital on Miss
            Davis' side and Labor on Becky Edelsohn's side.</p>
