        <head>THE HISTORY OF THE HUNGER-STRIKE</head>
        <p><person reg="Edelsohn, Rebecca">Becky Edelsohn</person> began her activities at
                <place>Union Square</place> at the first unemployed demonstration at Union Square,
            (March 21st), and since that time has been very active in various meetings, especially
            at Franklin Square Statue. She was arrested there once before, for making a collection
            for the unemployed, but was discharged by the Magistrate who claimed that she had as
            much right to make a collection as the <org>Salvation Army</org>. At the declaration of
            war with <place>Mexico</place> she organized the meeting at Franklin Statue on April
            22nd. She was arrested for speaking against the war and sentenced by Magistrate <person
                reg="Sims, Charles">Sims</person> to give a bond of $300 to keep the peace for three
            months. She defended her own case in Court and made a splendid stand for Free Speech.
            Magistrate Simms told her that the bond would not prevent her from speaking in public
            but whenever a policeman ordered her to stop she would have to do so. Miss Edelsohn
            refused to be censored by the police and refused to give the bond of $300. She declared
            a hunger-strike if sent to prison, as a protest against her sentence of ninety days
            imprisonment. She was sent to the workhouse but was transferred to the City Prison,
                <place reg="Long Island, NY">Long Island</place>. The <org>Free Speech League</org>
            appealed her case meanwhile getting Miss Edelsohn out of bail, April 25th, which for the
            time being terminated her hunger strike.</p>
        <p>Pending her appeal Miss Edelsohn continued her agitation against the <place>United
                States</place> becoming involved in war with Mexico and for the sympathetic strike
            for the miners in <place>Colorado</place>. It was in connection with this work that she
            participated in the meetings at <place reg="Tarrytown, NY">Tarrytown</place> where she
            was arrested with fourteen others for attempting to speak on the Colorado situation at
            Fountain Square, Tarrytown, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The Tarrytown prisoners were re-released on bail pending trial, and Miss Edelsohn
            continued her agitation in behalf of Labor.</p>
        <p>Justice <person reg="Crane, Frederick">Crane </person>of the Appellate sustained the
            sentence of the lower Court. On July 20th Miss Edelsohn was again called for sentence.
            She was given the option of a bond for $300 to keep the peace or go to jail for ninety
            days. She refused the bond. As a protest against her unjust sentence she at once
            declared a hunger-strike in Court. She was sent to the workhouse,<org
                reg="Blackwell's Island Penitentiary"> Blackwell's Island</org>, and has since then
            been carrying on her hunger-strike refusing both food and water. She is held in a
            veritable Spanish incommunicado. The authorities refusing her visitors or to receive or
            send any mail. She is denied the regular privileges of other prisoners. Only once was
            her lawyer, Mr. <person reg="Sheffield, Justus">Sheffield</person> permitted to see her
            and that was when he had to serve the writ of habeas corpus to bring Miss Edelsohn as a
            witness for the Tarrytown trial cases. No friend has been permitted to either visit her
            or communicate with her, though a sub rosa route has been established.</p>
        <p>In her last letters Miss Edelsohn informed her friends that she is suffering mental and
            physical torture, but she is determined to keep up her strike as a protest against the
            injustice done her even if her determination should involve the sacrifice of her
            life.</p>
        <p>The prison authorities have been spreading false reports to the effect that Miss Edelsohn
            has been taking food tablets and drinking water. Those statements are false. Miss
            Edelsohn has been taking neither food nor water except at times when taking laxative
            pills. She is now in a very low condition as she is liable to collapse at any time. Her
            friends fear that her health has been ruined beyond repair and that her further
            imprisonment will prove fatal. They demand her immediate release.</p>
