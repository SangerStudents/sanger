        <head>YOUR GUARDIANS</head>
        <p>If you fail to receive any number of this paper, you may conclude that the <org>United
                States Post Office</org> has decided that it is not fit for you to read. The Federal
            Authorities are most considerate in this respect. They are ever watchful over your
            morals, and are ever ready to interfere with any mail that might tend to corrupt them.
            We suggest that all readers write to the <person reg="Burleson, Albert S.">Postmaster
                General</person> and express appreciation for the kindly interest taken by the Post
            Office in keeping you pure and virtuous by prohibiting you from reading any matter that
            is adulterated with the truth. Our benign <org reg="United States Government"
                >Government</org> is certain that the truth is not only poisonous but obscene.</p>
