        <head>A QUESTION</head>
        <p>The question has been asked: What would THE <title type="journal">WOMAN REBEL</title> do
            with <person reg="Edelsohn, Rebecca">Rebecca Edelson</person> if she were in Dr. <person
                reg="Davis, Katharine Bement">Katherine B. Davis</person>' position?</p>
        <p>No woman rebel would ever find herself in such a degraded position. The view of the
            revolutionary woman is expressed adequately enough in other columns of this number.</p>
        <p>We have no respect for the type of so-called "modern" and "advanced" woman who becomes a
            willing and efficient slave of the present system, the woman who curries favors of
            capitalists and politicians in order to gain power and the cheap and fulsome praise of
            cheaper and more fulsome newspapers. If this is what "emancipation" means, give us the
            old slavery. As a matter of fact, it is the most degrading form of slavery to be forced
            to prey upon the misery of others for your livelihood. This <org
                reg="Blackwell's Island Penitentiary">Blackwell</org>'s drama should teach the suffrage advocates
            that they need expect no loyalty from the renegade members of their own sex who sell
            themselves to corrupt politicians as detectives, policewomen, and spies.</p>
