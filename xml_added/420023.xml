        <head>YOUR CRIME</head>
        <p><person reg="Edelsohn, Rebecca">Becky Edelsohn</person> was imprisoned for disorderly
            conduct. She is not disorderly. She is prisoner of conscience. She made an anti-war
            speech once when war with <place>Mexico</place> was popular. We have not forgotten Becky
            but we want the community to know that they and their <person reg="Mitchel, John Purroy"
                >Mayor</person>, their Judge, their Courts and their <person
                reg="Davis, Katharine Bement">Commissioner of Corrections</person> are all Becky's
            jailers. We do not aim to release Becky from her jail. She will release herself or she
            will die. We must understand our own crime.</p>
