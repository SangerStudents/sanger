        <head>THE <org reg="Birth Control League of America">BIRTH CONTROL LEAGUE</org></head>
        <p>The recently organized and much needed <org>Birth Control League of <place
                    reg="United States">America</place>
            </org>has for its aim as follows:</p>
        <p>1. To carry on an extensive, nationwide campaign of education, of literature, to prove to
            the workers that it is to their interests to have a thorough knowledge and understanding
            of the means for regulating the size of their families.</p>
        <p>2. To agitate most vigorously for the repeal of the state and federal laws against the
            spreading of knowledge relative to methods for the prevention of conception.</p>
        <p>3. To render all possible aid to those who are prosecuted under these laws, and to bring
            their cases to the attention of the entire <emph rend="italics">thinking</emph>
            world.</p>
        <p>The headquarters of the league will be in <place reg="New York, NY">New York
            City</place>, while autonomous locals will be organized all over the country to carry on
            the propaganda.</p>
        <p>Suffragettes, feminists and all women's organizations, will never make much progress,
            until they recognize the fact that women cannot be on an equal footing with men until
            they have full and complete control of their reproductive functions.</p>
        <p>We are anxious to hear all advocates of woman's emancipation, in connection with the
            question raised above.</p>
        <p>We want the help and co-operation of all enlightened women--mothers and potential
            mothers,--who see the danger and criminality of reckless and indiscriminate
            child-bearing--women who are not afraid to learn the physiology and hygiene of their own
            bodies.</p>
        <p>The membership dues are $1.50 a year, but additional contributions for a literature and
            campaign fund are badly needed.</p>
        <p>Address all letters and contributions to the Secretary, <person reg="Bobsien, Otto">Otto
                Bobsien</person>, 75 East 120th St., New York City.</p>
