        <head>CLASS AND CHARACTER</head>
        <head type="sub">Article No. 2.</head>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">THE GIRL AND CHARACTER.</head>
            <p>We cannot free mankind from its present slavery nor build up a new society until
                there exist constructive character among the individuals who shall create that
                society.</p>
            <p>It is seldom that character is associated with women; but always with men. A woman
                may be "sweet," "dainty," "good-hearted," "a good wife," "a good mother," and so
                forth, but seldom do they say that she is a woman of character.</p>
            <p>There is no need to catalogue special mental or moral traits of the most value to
                womankind, but certain it is that there are deep-seated dispositions and
                inclinations which are essential in the mental make-up of those who set before
                themselves a high ideal in seeking to attain an individuality.</p>
            <p>Every girl should aim to know herself; her desires; her inclinations; her weaknesses,
                and early in life decide what kind of character she would make of herself. She will
                find she has conflicting longings, both of a material and ideal kind, and it is well
                if she can experience and satisfy them as they come to her, especially, if they come
                strongly urged from within, for it is only by experience that she can know herself
                and discover what stands out strongest in her nature.</p>
            <p>It is only after an accumulated number of varied experiences that she will be able to
                set herself a standard or an ideal to live up to. It is then the time to grasp every
                opportunity, to act upon emotional promptings which are in the direction of the
                ideal she aspires to reach.</p>
            <p>Every girl is a magnet to attract or to be attracted. She is the strongest who
                attracts and draws to herself; who creates an atmosphere; who is free to express and
                give out those thoughts which "flash across the mind from within," all of which come
                through having a positive and creative character. A girl with such a personality is
                likely to draw negative characters to her -- persons who have no creative thoughts.
                Their tendency is to criticise and destroy any constructive idea she should express.
                She will at first have an instinctive antagonism to such persons. They sap, exhaust
                and take from her; they come to feed their egotistical natures upon her personality,
                to invade it, to use it or bend it for their own use. Her sympathies will often make
                her tolerant of such persons, and she overcomes her antagonism, but in the end they
                destroy her ideals, shatter her stability, and her individuality is weakened. It is
                not the one who comes in the garb of the enemy, who invades her; but the friend, the
                husband or the lover.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Her Aim:</head>
            <p>A girl is a law unto herself, in making herself into a well proportioned character.
                    "<q who="LOWJA">Not a failure but a low aim, is crime,</q>" said <person
                    reg="Lowell, James Russell">Lowell</person>. A girl should aim to make herself
                not a wife, or a housekeeper, or a business woman, or a mother, but a WOMAN, and
                develop her womanhood to its fullest capacity. Motherhood should not be the highest
                aim of a girl, for surely all animals may fulfill this function; rather let
                motherhood be one of the avenues through which the girl may pass in enriching her
                womanhood.</p>
            <p>The blossom cannot tell what becomes of its odor, a girl cannot tell what becomes of
                her influence and example. The girl agitator seemingly has to fight not only the
                boss, but the shop mates as well, who do not stand with her but let her fight their
                battles alone. Yet there is always that something pouring out of our lives like heat
                from a flame or perfume from a flower, and just that something will take root in the
                minds of the others, which a year later will set the whole shop aflame with revolt.
                There are girls who exert an influence out of all proportion to their ability, just
                as there have been women in history whose power over men was beyond understanding.
                Some would have us think it was the power of sex, but I claim it was character, and
                a strongly conscious character. In all the paintings by the great masters, there is
                always a central figure or idea which stands out boldly, everything is subordinate
                to it and finds it significance in pointing it out; so character should be the
                dominant feature of every personality, and a girl's experiences are but to enrich
                and fortify it.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">SOCIETY AND THE WORKER.</head>
            <p>There is inherent in all human beings a desire, as insistent as that for food and
                drink, to live a high and noble life, doing good to our fellow creatures, together
                with a deep social love for all mankind. That this spirit of love and kindness has
                been seized upon by a few whose greed for power has turned mankind into classes of
                masters and slaves, no one who is awakened to the social and industrial conditions
                existing to-day can doubt. In the meanwhile, what chance has a girl who toils for
                bread, shelter, and a few covering rags, to develop her character? What kind of
                character should she build, under existing conditions? What should be her attitude
                toward society? How can she develop herself and at the same time help her class to
                free itself? These are the questions she will ask herself, and will continue to keep
                in mind.</p>
            <p>Is it not insulting to the intelligence of the working class, who do all the
                drudgery, all the serving, all the toil; who make garments of warmth, comfort and
                beauty for others while they and theirs go in rags, and ugliness, who produce and
                make the choicest food, while they and theirs go hungry, and die by the thousands of
                diseases from starvation; to ask or expect them to look upon life from the same view
                point as the master class.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head>MASTER MORALITY.</head>
            <p>The test of civilization is not the size of its cities nor its marvelous inventions
                or discoveries, but the kind of men and women it develops. Certainly there is little
                manhood or womanhood in the slaves of any country who submit tamely to their
                fetters.</p>
            <p>If we could infuse into our everyday work the sense of beauty, pleasure and harmony,
                we would soon grow from artisans into artists, but there is no choice to-day of the
                kind we would like to do or how it shall be done. It must be done quickly as an
                output; for the lords of industry have no souls for art, their natures are tainted
                with greed, love for humanity or its progress they have never felt. It is this
                survival of greed for power which the workers must defend themselves against if they
                would survive. To love your master allows him to turn that love into profits for
                himself; he profits and feeds upon all such qualities as meekness, kindness,
                unselfishness, humility, faithfulness, honesty, truthfulness. Revalue these
                attributes to fit your class interests, and you will hear the howl come from the
                moralists.</p>
            <p>A revolution will be won or lost, not only by the spirit of the moment, but by the
                formation of the characters of revolutionists years before. "<q who="LOWJA">Men did
                    what the gods forced them to do</q>" was the idea which permeated Ancient
                    <place>Greece</place>. Through this philosophy they became stagnant, atrophied,
                and sensuous. This same idea has to some extent influenced the world ever since. In
                Christian <place>Europe</place> it found its expression in the doctrine of
                predestination. Such a philosophy cuts the nerve of endeavor. Mankind rots and
                stagnates under it. There is the same tendency among us to-day in the revolutionary
                movement. We have come to think that men and women can have no development until the
                bread and butter question has been settled, whereas, the truth is, there is too much
                soul starvation among us and too little self-development along resisting class
                conscious lines.<person reg="Emerson, Ralph Waldo">Emerson</person> says every great
                woman is a compelled woman, what she did she did because she must, for she is
                compelled by something within her which he calls character. There must be something
                finer in her than anything she can say, for character is greater than any
                career.</p>

            <head>A NEW KEYNOTE.</head>
            <p>The self-sacrifice of women, both primitive and civilized, has partly unfitted her
                for social organization of the world's work. She has at last evolved out of this
                state and has come to stay in her new attitude toward the world. </p>
            <p>Keep the faculty of mental effect alive by exercise, and develop moral courage which
                gives one calm in storms and fearlessness under persecution.</p>
            <p>The absolute consecration and devotion of self to the emancipation of her class is
                the secret of character building in a girl. It is such sublime living as shall stamp
                the features with the finest and rarest beauty. Without ideals there can be no
                beauty.</p>
            <p>It is this struggle for the ideal, this fight which shall create a womanhood who
                shall not be content to die peacefully of old age by the fireside, but shall insist
                upon being ever present on the firing line as long as there exists a tyrant or a
                master to be overcome; a womanhood which shall be ready to battle, to keep her
                ideals and standards high, for which jails, and scaffolds shall have no terrors.</p>
