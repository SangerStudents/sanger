        <head>CANTANKEROUS KATHERINE</head>
        <p>The recent revolt of the prisoners in <org>Blackwell's Island</org> against the
            unbearable tyranny of Warden <person reg="Hayes, Patrick">Hayes</person> should prove to
                <person reg="Davis, Katharine Bement">Katherine B. Davis</person>, the 'commissioner
            of correction,' that cruelty, when exercised on men, only breeds rebellion. It is to be
            feared, however, that the lesson is altogether lost on the fossilized reactionary
            female, who is at present responsible for the prison administration.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the situation in Blackwell's Island, one of the morning newspapers, whose
            name is not fit to print, says: "<q who="UNK">The population of the 'coolers,' strange
                to say, is increasing. On Sunday, July 13th, 16 were confined there, but now there
                are 24. It is understood that informers in the prison have picked out a number of
                disturbers.</q>" <person reg="Tannenbaum, Frank">Frank Tannenbaum</person>, the
            courageous <org reg="Industrial Workers of the World ">I. W. W.</org> boy, has been in
            one of these coolers for 130 hours. He has been forced to sleep on a damp cement floor
            and in the whole of the time he has been incarcerated in solitary confinement, has been
            allowed only two pounds of bread!! Other prisoners fared as badly.</p>
        <p>The women of the State of <place>New York</place> should truly be proud of the first
            Woman Police Commissioner who tried in vain to make sneaks and tattlers of men by
            coercing them into "snitching" on their comrades. How womanly of her to shake hands with
            the bath attendant who licked her boots in his endeavor to curry favor, and told her
            what he had overheard the prisoners say.</p>
        <p>Women who hope for recognition of their rights and look for that time when they shall
            hold office equal with men, have a striking proof of it here. The Club of Capitalism
            will descend upon their heads with the same brutality in the hands of women as in the
            hands of their lords and masters.</p>
        <p>Vote on, sweated toilers, and hats off to the first Woman Police Commissioner and Strike
            Breaker.</p>
