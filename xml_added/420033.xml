        <head>WOMEN AWAKENING</head>
        <p>Letters from working women which may be found in another column are typical of the
            awakening spirit for conscious procreation. This spirit and this demand for adequate
            information is forced upon the nurse and the doctor every day of their lives.</p>
        <p>It is time that intelligent women should refuse to allow themselves to be mastered by
            Ignorance, whether it assumes the guise of the Priest, the Teacher or the Judge!</p>
        <p>It is the experience of physicians and nurses in the thickly congested quarters, also of
            those with clinical experience where only the poorer women of the cities come for
            medical advice that almost all these women desire the knowledge which will prevent
            conception.</p>
        <p>Current among the smug and comfortable women of the upper class, is an idea that the
            workers have large families because they are so "lacking in self restraint", that they
            "breed like animals."</p>
        <p>These same people become Moralists at the suggestion that the same "breeders" have
            information which would keep them from having so many children.</p>
        <p>One <person reg="Unknown">physician</person> with ten years clinical work says: "<q
                who="UNK">whenever a woman is the least bit above the lower level, she desires to
                cease having children. No request is made of me oftener in the clinic than for
                advice along these lines.</q>"</p>
        <p>It would be interesting to know what advice they receive. Seldom can it be obtained at
            the clinic, seldom will a doctor give it, unless it is given where he is already
            established as a family physician.</p>
        <p>Where then is the woman of the people to get this information, so important to her
            health, and happiness, which she so greatly desires?</p>
        <p>We know that all the sex instruction she has been allowed to receive, has been tainted
            with the slime of the gutters. Is it not time to demand clean, scientific information
            from its right source?</p>
        <p>The Church, State and big business will continue to keep the slaves in ignorance, and
            continue in its hypocritical attitude with milk stations, baby benefits, etc. until the
            women demand the proper and intelligent means of Birth Control.</p>
