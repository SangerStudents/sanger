        <head>WHY THE WOMAN REBEL?</head>
        <p>Because I believe that deep down in woman's nature lies slumbering the spirit of
            revolt.</p>
        <p>Because I believe that woman is enslaved by the world machine, by sex conventions, by
            motherhood and its present necessary child-rearing, by wage-slavery, by middle-class
            morality, by customs, laws and superstitions.</p>
        <p>Because I believe that woman's freedom depends upon awakening that spirit of revolt
            within her against these things which enslave her.</p>
        <p>Because I believe that these things which enslave woman must be fought openly,
            fearlessly, consciously.</p>
        <p>Because I believe she must consciously disturb and destroy and be fearless in its
            accomplishment.</p>
        <p>Because I believe in freedom, created through individual action.</p>
        <p>Because I believe in the offspring of the immigrant, the great majority of whom make up
            the unorganized working class to-day.</p>
        <p>Because I believe that this immigrant with a vision, an ideal of a new world where
            liberty, freedom, kindness, plenty hold sway, who had courage to leave the certain old
            for the uncertain new to face a strange new people, new habits, a strange language, for
            this vision, this ideal, certainly has brought to this country a wholesome spirit of
            unrest which this generation of Americans has lost through a few generations of
            prosperity and respectability.</p>
        <p>Because I believe that on the courage, vision and idealism of the immigrant and the
            offspring does the industrial revolution depend.</p>
        <p>Because I believe that through the efforts of the industrial revolution will woman's
            freedom emerge.</p>
        <p>Because I believe that not until wage slavery is abolished can either woman's or man's
            freedom be fully attained.</p>
        <p>Because I have six months' time to devote to arousing this slumbered spirit in the
            working woman, and if within this time I shall have succeeded in arousing my own laggard
            self I shall have succeeded sufficiently to continue this paper until all the slumbered
            spirits have awakened to its assistance or its destruction.</p>
