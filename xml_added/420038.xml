        <head>THE PREVENTION OF CONCEPTION</head>
        <p> Is there any reason why women should not receive clean, harmless, scientific knowledge
            on how to prevent conception? Everybody is aware that the old, stupid fallacy that such
            knowledge will cause a girl to enter into prostitution has long been shattered. Seldom
            does a prostitute become pregnant. Seldom does the girl practicing promiscuity become
            pregnant. The woman of the upper middle class have all available knowledge and
            implements to prevent conception. The woman of the lower middle class is struggling for
            this knowledge. She tries various methods of prevention, and after a few years of
            experience plus medical advice succeeds in discovering some method suitable to her
            individual self. The woman of the people is the only one left in ignorance of this
            information. Her neighbors, relatives and friends tell her stories of special devices
            and the success of them all. They tell her also of the blood-sucking men with M. D.
            after their names who perform operations for the price of so-and-so. But the working
            woman's purse is thin. It's far cheaper to have a baby, "<q who="UNK">though <name
                    type="deity">God</name> knows what it will do after it gets here.</q>" Then,
            too, all other classes of women live in places where there is at least a semblance of
            privacy and sanitation. It is easier for them to care for themselves whereas the large
            majority of the women of the people have no bathing or sanitary conveniences. This
            accounts too for the fact that the higher the standard of living, the more care can be
            taken and fewer children result. No plagues, famines or wars could ever frighten the
            capitalist class so much as the universal practice of the prevention of conception. On
            the other hand no better method could be utilized for increasing the wages of the
            workers. </p>
        <p>As is well known, a law exists forbidding the imparting of information on this subject,
            the penalty being several years' imprisonment. Is it not the time to defy this law? And
            what fitter place could be found than in the pages of the <title type="journal">WOMAN
                REBEL</title>.</p>
