        <head>THE AIM</head>
        <p>This paper will not be the champion of any "ism."</p>
        <p>All rebel women are invited to contribute to its columns.</p>
        <p>The majority of the papers usually adjust themselves to the ideas of their readers but
            the <title type="journal">WOMAN REBEL</title> will obstinately refuse to be
            adjusted.</p>
        <p>The aim of this paper will be to stimulate working women to think for themselves and to
            build up a conscious fighting character.</p>
        <p>An early feature will be a series of articles written by the <person
                reg="Sanger, Margaret">editor</person> for girls from fourteen to eighteen years of
            age. In this present chaos of sex atmosphere it is difficult for the girl of this
            uncertain age to know just what to do or really what constitutes clean living without
            prudishness. All this slushy talk about white slavery, the man painted and described as
            a hideous vulture pouncing upon the young, pure and innocent girl, drugging her through
            the medium of grape juice and lemonade and then dragging her off to his foul den for
            other men equally as vicious to feed and fatten on her enforced slavery--surely this
            picture is enough to sicken and disgust every thinking woman and man, who has lived even
            a few years past the adolescent age. Could any more repulsive and foul conception of sex
            be given to adolescent girls as a preparation for life than this picture that is being
            perpetuated by the stupidly ignorant in the name of "sex education"?</p>
        <p>If it were possible to get the truth from girls who work in prostitution to-day, I
            believe most of them would tell you that the first sex experience was with a sweetheart
            or through the desire for a sweetheart or something impelling within themselves, the
            nature of which they knew not, neither could they control. Society does not forgive this
            act when it is based upon the natural impulses and feelings of a young girl. It prefers
            the other story of the grape juice procurer which makes it easy to shift the blame from
            its own shoulders, to cast the stone and to evade the unpleasant facts that it alone is
            responsible for. It sheds sympathetic tears over white slavery, holds the often mythical
            procurer up as a target, while in reality it is supported by the misery it
            engenders.</p>
        <p>If, as reported, there are approximately 35,000 women working as prostitutes in <place
                reg="New York, NY">New York City</place> alone, is it not sane to conclude that some
            force, some living, powerful, social force is at play to compel these women to work at a
            trade which involves police persecution, social ostracism and the constant danger of
            exposure to venereal diseases. From my own knowledge of adolescent girls and from
            sincere expressions of women working as prostitutes inspired by mutual understanding and
            confidence I claim that the first sexual act of these so-called wayward girls is partly
            given, partly desired yet reluctantly so because of the fear of the consequences
            together with the dread of lost respect of the man. These fears interfere with mutuality
            of expression--the man becomes conscious of the responsibility of the act and often
            refuses to see her again, sometimes leaving the town and usually denouncing her as
            having been with "other fellows." His sole aim is to throw off responsibility. The same
            uncertainty in these emotions is experienced by girls in marriage in as great a
            proportion as in the unmarried. After the first experience the life of a girl varies.
            All these girls do not necessarily go into prostitution. They have had an experience
            which has not "ruined" them, but rather given them a larger vision of life, stronger
            feelings and a broader understanding of human nature. The adolescent girl does not
            understand herself. She is full of contradictions, whims, emotions. For her emotional
            nature longs for caresses, to touch, to kiss. She is often as well satisfied to hold
            hands or to go arm in arm with a girl as in the companionship of a boy.</p>
        <p>It is these and kindred facts upon which the <title type="journal">WOMAN REBEL</title>
            will dwell from time to time and from which it is hoped the young girl will derive some
            knowledge of her nature, and conduct her life upon such knowledge.</p>
        <p>It will also be the aim of the <title type="journal">WOMAN REBEL</title> to advocate the
            prevention of conception and to impart such knowledge in the columns of this paper.</p>
        <p>Other subjects, including the slavery through motherhood; through things, the home,
            public opinion and so forth, will be dealt with.</p>
        <p>It is also the aim of this paper to circulate among those women who work in prostitution;
            to voice their wrongs; to expose the police persecution which hovers over them and to
            give free expression to their thoughts, hopes and opinions.</p>
        <p>And at all times the <title type="journal">WOMAN REBEL</title> will strenuously advocate
            economic emancipation.</p>
