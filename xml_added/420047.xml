        <head>WORLD BUILDERS?</head>
        <p><person reg="Dell, Floyd">Floyd Dell</person> has evidently done his best to make his ten
            representative feminist world builders as harmless as possible. Some of them could never
            be anything else. Among the women whom the author gowns with the grace of his courteous
            rhetoric are <person reg="Key, Ellen">Ellen Key</person>, <person
                reg="Robins, Margaret Dreier">Margaret D. Robins,</person>
            <person reg="Webb, Beatrice">Beatrice Webb</person>, <person reg="Schreiner, Olive"
                >Olive Schreiner</person>, <person reg="Duncan, Isadora">Isadora Duncan</person>,
                <person reg="Pankhurst, Emmeline">Emmeline Pankhurst</person> (not <person
                reg="Pankhurst, Christabel">Christabel</person> or <person reg="Pankhurst, Sylvia"
                >Sylvia</person>), <person reg="Addams, Jane">Jane Addams</person>, and of course,
                <person reg="Gilman, Charlotte Perkins">Charlotte Perkins Gilman</person>. That
            these eight are all feminists, none will deny. That any of them are world builders is a
            debatable question.</p>
        <p>The other two types, <person reg="Goldman, Emma">Emma Goldman</person> and <person
                reg="Marsden, Dora">Dora Marsden</person>, whom Dell deals with, are forces rather
            than feminists. But we read with astonishment that Emma Goldman shuns violence in her
            fight for freedom; that the Anarchists have lost influence in the labor movement and are
            a negligible factor, and that secret organizations of Anarchists plotting a violent
            overthrow of government "<q who="DELFL">do not exist</q>" and never have existed. Since
            when has Emma Goldman ceased to advocate violence and revolution as the only means to
            overthrow the murderous and mischievous rule of plutocracy? And has Floyd ever heard of
                <person reg="Bakunin, Michael">Bakunin,</person>
            <person reg="Michel, Louise">Michel</person> or <person reg="Malatesta, Errico"
                >Malatesta</person>? Does he know anything of their activities?</p>
