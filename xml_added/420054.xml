        <head>THE UNFIT</head>
        <p>In an article on "<title type="article">The Parent and the State</title>," <person
                reg="Heath, H. L.">H. L. Heath</person> claims that in manufacturing towns there is
            a great risk in intermarriages amongst men and women of the working class; a danger of
            the offspring being more and more enfeebled. In other words women and men of the working
            class are so drained and exhausted in health and energy by their work, poor food and bad
            housing, that it is impossible for them to give birth to healthy offspring, thus making
            them unfit. Can the working woman of this country be any thing but unfit when at ten and
            twelve years they are sent into mills and factories to work in unhealthy and insanitary
            dwellings? The most important epoch in a woman's life--that age of the girl from twelve
            to eighteen--is spent in grinding out riches for the master class when she should be at
            leisure to develop into a healthy womanhood.</p>
        <p>Statistics tell us that more than 150,000 children in the <place>United States</place>,
            under five years of age, die each year, the greatest number by far being the offspring
            of working women. It is the foreign women who maintain and increase the population in
            America. The higher woman goes into social and intellectual life, the less is she
            inclined to become a child-bearing machine for any flag.</p>
