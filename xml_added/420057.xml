        <head>CONSISTENCY</head>
        <p>The inconsistency of the <org reg="New York State Government">Government of <place>New
                    York</place>
            </org>show themselves more and more, as it proceeds to interfere with the private
            relations of the individuals. The latest laughable act in the action of the <org
                reg="New York State Court of Appeals">Court of Appeals of New York State</org> which
            upheld the <org reg="New York State Board of Education">Board of Education</org> in
                <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place> in dismissing Mrs. <person
                reg="Peixotto, Bridget C.">Bridget C. Peixotto</person> because she remained away
            from her duties as a teacher to become a mother. It was no objection to her as a married
            woman, but does object to her as a mother. Yet this same government holds it a crime to
            tell the woman how to prevent conception and thereby avoid motherhood.</p>
