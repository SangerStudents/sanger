            <p>For a concise and lucid survey of the revolutionary movement of the world and sane
                interpretation of radical forces and programs, you should subscribe to "<title type="journal">Land
                    and Liberty</title>," published at <place reg="Hayward, CA">Hayward,
                    California</place>. The first number, published in May, was excellent; and the
                second number was better than the first. "<title type="journal">LAND AND
                    LIBERTY</title>" throws light on passing events instead of indulging in vague
                and visionary theories about social salvation. It emphasizes the value of
                intelligent editorship in revolutionary papers. Let us hope that other revolutionary
                publishers may profit by the appearance of "<title type="journal">LAND AND
                    LIBERTY.</title>" Send one dollar for a year's subscription, or at any rate send
                a postcard for a sample copy.</p>

            <p>Here is a typical front-page "story" of those newspapers who pride themselves on
                printing all the news that's "fit to print." It is from the <title type="journal">N.
                    Y. Evening Mail</title> of April 16, and was NOT suppressed by the
                    <org>post-office</org> authorities. It is a "good story" and an every-day
                comment on American "civilization." </p>

                <q who="NYEM">"Mrs. <person reg="Vogel, Katherine">Katherine Vogel</person>,
                    sixty-one years old, committed suicide in her apartment at 34 First avenue
                    to-day by drinking carbolic acid.</q>

            <p>"<q who="NYEM">In the next room lay the body of a girl about twenty years old, the
                    victim of an operation alleged to have been performed by Mrs. Vogel. The
                    identity of the girl is not known. It is believed she was a professional
                    dancer.</q>" </p>
