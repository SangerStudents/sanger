        <head>SAVE RANGEL CLINE ET AL FROM "<q>TEXAS JUSTICE,</q>"</head>
        <p>The <org reg="Industrial Workers of the World">I. W. W.</org>, labor and radical
            organizations and groups everywhere are showing their solidarity by combining for the
            defense of <person reg="Rangel, Jesus M.">Rangel</person>, <person reg="Cline, Charles"
                >Cline</person>, <person reg="Alzalde, Eugenio">Alzade</person>, <person
                reg="Cisneros, Jose Abraham">Cisneros</person> and our other ten comrades now
            undergoing trial for their activity in the cause of industrial freedom. Money has been
            collected, but more is needed, for 'justice' is expensive, though not so dear in
                <place>Texas</place> but that Labor cannot afford to "buy" and effect the liberation
            of our comrades. So send in your contributions to the <org>Rangel-Cline Defense
                Committee</org>, Financial Secretary, <person reg="Cravello, Victor">Victor
                Cravello</person>, Room 108, <org>Labor Temple</org>, <place>Los Angeles,
                California</place>.</p>
        <p>The reversal of the brutal sentence of fifteen years in the penitentiary passed on
                <person reg="Vasquez, Leonard">Leonardo Vasquez</person> and the granting of a new
            trial is encouraging. All that is needed now in order that our comrades may be saved
            from the gallows or the penitentiary is one final rally of a united working class, to
            enforce their acquittal.</p>
        <p>Make your protest heard by the Texan Governor, <person reg="Colquitt, Oscar B.">Oscar B.
                Colquitt</person>, <place reg="Austin, TX">Austin, Texas</place>. Remember that our
            exploiters are crazy for the blood of all who rebel against their authority and their
            system of ownership, and now more than ever before it is necessary to press home to the
            masters our solidarity and determination to take that justice into our own hands which
            they and their class deny to all industrial workers.</p>
