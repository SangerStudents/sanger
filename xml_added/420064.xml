        <head>Civilization?</head>
        <p>Speaking at an anti-war meeting of women in <org>Cooper Union</org>, Mrs. <person
                reg="Gilman, Charlotte Perkins">Gilman</person> said that war was a disgrace to our
            civilization. </p>
        <p>Whose civilization? The civilization of the Oil Czar and his accomplices? What is the
            difference between war in <place>Mexico</place> and the war in <place>Colorado</place>?
            And which is the most disgraceful of the two?</p>
        <p>The workers are just beginning to realize that civilization is war. In reality it is
            worse than war, because the rules of civilized warfare are not observed in this social
            contest by the dominating class. <person reg="Rockefeller, John D., Jr."
                >Rockefeller</person> may organize the slaughter of men, women and children and go
            to Church the following Sunday without losing in power, prestige or respectability. He
            is accountable to nobody. Nobody can arrest him; for the police, the army and the courts
            give him protection. </p>
        <p>But who protects the workers?</p>
