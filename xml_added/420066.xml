        <head>HUNTING BIG GAME</head>
        <p>Mr. <person reg="Barrow, Edward M.">Edward M. Barrow</person>'s report on the children of
            the city streets informs us that 12,000 of them are arrested every year in <place
                reg="New York, NY">New York City</place> alone. The crime of the children consists
            of playing in the streets. The business of corralling the children and imprisoning them
            is growing every year. With the building of new prisons and reformatories and increasing
            the number of well-paid probation officers and investigators and other respectable
            meddlers, perhaps the city officials may be able to increase this number to 24,000 in a
            year or two. It is a great business, this one of running down the kids, and gives a lot
            of people who might otherwise be idle something interesting and humanitarian to do!</p>
