<p><person reg="Davis, Katharine Bement">Catherine B. Davis</person>, Commissioner of Correction for
<place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>, stated that a very serious cause of a girl becoming
a prostitute was "<q who="DAVKA">her great desire for the good things of life which is far in
advance of her capability to earn them...</q>" Consequently, Catherine is considering building a
structure large enough to house 14,000 prostitutes, where their natural desires shall be elevated to
loftier ones, such as potato peeling, scrubbing floors, dish washing, etc. Thus will the Social Evil
vanish!</p>

<p><person reg="Hale, Beatrice Forbes-Robertson">Beatrice Forbes-Robertson Hale</person> said at a
debate on feminism that she knew of only two feminists who advocated free love and unmarried
motherhood, and that they were not suffragists, but anarchists. What a limited knowledge of women
Mrs. Hale has! Perhaps after all self respect and morality <emph rend="bold">are</emph> confined to
the anarchist women!</p>
