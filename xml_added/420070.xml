            <p>Who was that dainty feminist who informed the public that as soon as women got the
                vote, they would make the laws for working women and children?--How hopeful! Not
                that children should be taken from the factories and put into schools and
                playgrounds! That would be getting off their little crooked backs. But ever willing
                to color it a little and to trim it a bit they will accomplish all that was ever
                intended to do with their vote.</p>

            <p><person reg="Rodman, Henrietta">Henrietta Rodman</person>, well known in radical

                    Lewes</person>.</p>

                let us know that she did not stand for free love--she left that to the
                Anarchists.</p>
            <p>Now what was the trouble, Henrietta? Surely no one ever doubted your virtue!</p>
