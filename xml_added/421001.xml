    <docBody>
        <p>It is my great pleasure to tell you that when Dr. <person reg="Pusey, William Allen"
                >William Allen Pusey</person>, president of the <org
                reg="American Medical Association">American medical association</org> made his
            inspiring address to the medical profession and called upon them not to get behind the
            birth control movement but to get ahead of it, to lead it, he helped us in enlisting the
            cooperation of the medical profession and courageous scientists. We are no longer voices
            crying aloud in the wilderness. It is therefore with great gratitude and pleasure that I
            introduce as our first speaker this evening a clinical instructor in the <org>Boston
                University of Medicine</org>, whose wide experience in his profession is not
            confined to this country, who has long studied the problems of birth control and is
            courageous enough to express publicly the results of his studies.</p>
        <p>I feel greatly honored in introducing to you Dr. <person reg="Cooper, James F.">James F.
                Cooper</person>.</p>
