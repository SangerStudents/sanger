        <p>I am sure that I am speaking for everyone here in thanking Dr. <person
                reg="Cooper, James F.">Cooper</person> for his inspiring and generous cooperation
            with our movement by speaking here tonight, and for throwing so much light on phases of
            birth control that are unfamiliar to most laymen.</p>
        <p>There is still another phase of the problem which is often neglected. Most of us know
            that are laws throughout the country forbidding the dissemination of contraceptive
            information. If physicians and scientists passively accept those laws the whole
            community suffers. There is no way to find out the scope of such laws except by changing
            them and thus testing their vitality- or rather their deadliness. The <name type="law"
                reg="New York State Penal Code, Section 1145">New York State Law</name> was
            challenged as far back a 1916. It was a costly experiment but the benefits and the
            knowledge wehave gained by that challenge have enabled the medical profession and
            scientists to widen the scope of their investigation and research. The case was carried
            to the <org reg="United States Supreme Court">Supreme Court</org> and a decision was
            handed down stating that for the cure or prevention of disease physicians might advocate
            contraceptive measures.</p>
        <p>Upon that decision it was imperative to establish a precedent and after through
            preparation, support and advice we succeeded in establishing a <org
                reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">bureau</org> for clinical research.</p>
        <p>This bureau has now been in operation for nearly two years.</p>
        <p>It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you its medical directory who will tell you
            some of the results of her patient labors, Dr. <person reg="Bocker, Dorothy">Dorothy
                Bocker</person>.</p>
