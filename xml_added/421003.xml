    <docBody>
        <p>I <del>believe</del> know that all of you must agree with me in my belief that such calm,
            dispassionate research as Dr. Bocker's <del>work</del>
            <add>statement</add> reveals will do much to awaken not only the interest and respect of
            the people of the community but to awaken and stimulate the interest of other scientists
            and physicians in the medical aspects of birth control.</p>
        <p>Now I think that this is the most appropriate moment to announce a further victory for
            the <org>American Birth Control League</org>. I consider it a distinct victory to be
            able to announce to you tonight that the <org
                reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 6th">6th
                International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference</org> is to be held here
            in <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> next March. This follows on the highly
            successful conferences held in <place reg="Paris, France">Paris</place> in 1901, in
                <place reg="Liege, Belgium">Liege</place> in 1905, the <place
                reg="Hague, Netherlands">Hague</place> in 1910, in <place reg="Dresden, Germany"
                >Dresden</place>, 1911 and <place reg="London, United Kingdom">London</place>
            1922.</p>
        <p>For the first time in its history the foremost authorities on the problems of population
            are coming from every civilized country of the world as our guests.</p>
        <p>All of you who have shown your interest in this subject by coming here tonight may take
            advantage of this great educational opportunity to see and hear our eminent speakers in
            the various sessions.</p>
        <p>We have already invited a large number of men preeminent in their chosen fields*- men
            like <person reg="Keynes, John Maynard">John Maynard Keynes</person>, the economist, Sir
                <person reg="Lankester, Edwin Ray">Ray Lankester</person>, the great English
            scientist; Lord <person reg="Buckmaster, Stanley">Buckmaster</person>, probably the
            finest legal mind in <place>Great Britain</place>; Professor <person
                reg="MacBride, E. W.">MacBride</person> the well known biologist of <org
                reg="University of London">London University</org>; <person
                reg="Westermarck, Edward">Edward Westermarck</person>, renowned as a profound
            student of the institution of marriage; men like <person reg="Wells, H. G.">H. G.
                Wells</person>, <person reg="Shaw, Bernard">Bernard Shaw</person> and <person
                reg="Bennett, Arnold">Arnold Bennett</person>. There are already acceptances of
            delegates from <place>Hungary</place>, <place>Austria</place>, <place>Germany</place>,
                <place>France</place> from the <place>Orient</place>, <place>India</place>, and
                <place>Japan</place>.</p>
        <p>The sessions during these five days will be a sort of temporary university on all the
            deep problems of civilization- opening new vistas into the whole future of the human
            race. Nothing so wide in its scope has ever happened in this country before.</p>
        <p>But I am taking time from our next speaker who is going to tell you something of the
            legal status of birth control. He will also tell you something more of this conference
            and how we can all cooperate to make it a great success in the eyes of the world. It
            gives me real pleasure to introduce to you Mr. <person reg="Thurman, I. N.">I. N.
                Thurman</person>.</p>
