        <head>Mrs. Margaret Sanger's Move Assures Birth Control Clinic for
            Harlemites</head>
        <head type="sub">Uptown Social Workers Throw Strength Behind Drive for
            $3,000 Needed-Would Reduce Infant Mortality Rate</head>
        <q who="NYAN">
            <p>Social workers of <place reg="New York, NY">Harlem</place>, in a
                meeting Thursday evening in the assembly room of the New York
                Urban League, 202 West 136th Street, endorsed the movement
                headed by Margaret Sanger, white, to establish a birth control
                clinic in Harlem. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Sanger, internationally known authority on birth control,
                in outlining plans for the establishment of such a clinic in
                Harlem, spoke first of the need in Harlem for such an
                institution. </p></q>
        <p>“Many mothers,” she said, “complain that the <org
                reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">Fifteenth street
                clinic</org> is too far from their homes to be conveniently
            reached. This is especially true of the mothers with very young
            children. The establishment of a birth control clinic in Harlem may
            be regarded as an expensive venture but it is really the cheapest
            charity known today. Birth control reduces both infant and maternal
            mortality. The health of the mother is improved and the economic
            condition of the entire family is raised. </p>
        <p>“During the past five years, in our Fifteenth street clinic, we have
            handled successfully 15,000 cases. These cases have proved that
            birth control is a necessity; that it is a success; and that it is
            doing good.”</p>
        <p><q who="NYAN">At the close of Mrs. Sanger’s lecture, a discussion of
                the proposed clinic was led by Dr. <person reg="Chinn, May">Mae
                    Chinn</person> of <org>Harlem Hospital</org>. Dr. Chinn
                said:</q></p>
        <p>
            <q who="CHIMA">“Harlem needs such a clinic as Mrs. Sanger has
                described. Most of the criticism directed against the birth
                control movement is erroneous. Such information as is given out
                by the clinic will be carefully given, and to suit the
                individual needs of each particular case.”</q></p>
        <p>
            <q who="NYAN">Resolutions were adopted endorsing the movement. Mrs.
                Sanger has already secured $2,000. The endorsement of the
                movement by the social workers of Harlem insures the gift of an
                additional $5,000. This leaves only $3,000 to be raised, as
                $10,000 is the total amount needed for the clinic.</q>
