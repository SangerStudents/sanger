            Theorists.</head>
        <p>
            <q who="NYT">Objecting to the encyclical issued recently by Pope
                    <person reg="Pius XI">Pius XI</person> dealing with
                marriage, Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret
                    Sanger</person> issued a statement yesterday from the office
                of the <org reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">Birth
                    Control Clinical Research Bureau</org>, at 17 West Sixteenth
                Street. </q></p>
        <p>“It is ridiculous to brand as immoral certain modern ideas on
            marriage because they do not agree with what <person
                reg="Augustine of Hippo">St. Augustine</person> thought fifteen
            centuries ago,” Mrs. Sanger declared.</p>
        <p>“The encyclical bristles with quotations from ancient theorists who
            had never been married, instead of presenting a fresh study of the
            economic and social conditions which surround human beings
            today.”</p>
        <p>
            <q who="NYT">Referring to the statement in the encyclical that</q>
                “<q who="PIUXI">the frustration of procreation is a sin against
                nature</q>,” Mrs. Sanger stated: “I think that to say ‘sin
            against nature’ is only a manner of speaking. All of us, the Pope
            included, are habitually defeating the ways of nature; the advance
            of civilization has been achieved by triumphing over nature.” </p>
