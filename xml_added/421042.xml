        <head>200 Hear Mrs. Sanger</head>
        <head type="sub">She Discusses Birth Control Clinic Before Social Workers</head>
        <p><q>"About 200 social workers from the staffs of hospitals, child welfare organizations,
                settlement and neighborhood houses attended a tea yesterday afternoon at the
                    <org>Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</org>, 17 West Sixteenth Street, to
                hear addresses by Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>,
                director of the bureau, and Dr.<person reg="Stone, Hannah M.">Hannah M.
                    Stone</person>, its medical director.</q> “<q who="SANMA">Many families who have
                been on the records of welfare associations for years have been so helped after
                visiting our clinic that they no longer need agency aid,</q>” Mrs. Sanger told the
            workers. “<q who="SANMA">Much money, time, and unhappiness could be saved if families
                were given birth control information when first contacted by welfare workers.</q>”
                <q>"Many workers said they had previously refrained from visiting the clinic because
                they were uncertain of its legal status.</q></p>
