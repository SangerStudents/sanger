            Women.</head>
        <p>“I have often felt sad about one aspect of Christianity since it dawned upon me that it
            had set the clock of women’s progress back for centuries,” Mrs. Sanger said. “Now with
            the amend made by the <org reg="Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America"
                >Federal Council of Churches</org>, woman has achieved justice at length through the
            recognition of birth control as a means of making happier homes and happier marriages. I
            believe that every woman’s organization in the country should give thanks for the
            forward stand taken by the council looking toward woman’s freedom and women’s progress.”
            She went on to assert that the government should “offer a life pension to every
            feeble-minded person who would consent to be sterilized.” </p>
