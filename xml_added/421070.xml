            <p> Two danger spots in the world today are threatening peace, Mrs.
                    <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>,
                birth control advocate, said in an address to 500 members of
                    <org reg="Oklahoma City Town Hall">Town Hall</org>, <org
                    reg="Junior League of Oklahoma City">Junior League</org>
                lecture series, today in the <org>Biltmore Hotel.</org></p>
            <p>
                <place>Japan</place> has already burst her bounds and taken
                    <place>Manchuria</place>. The next will be
                    <place>Italy</place>, which is boosting its birth rate just
                as <place>Japan</place> did, she said. </p></q>
        <p>“Within 10 years,” Mrs. Sanger said, “Italy will march into
                <place>Europe</place> to prove that ‘might makes right.’
            Population explodes just like steam in a boiler. Uncontrolled there
            is no way in the world to prevent revolution and war.” </p>
        <p>“Our world today,” she said, “is in the same condition in reference
            to its ignorance of birth control as was the old-fashioned quack who
            tried to cure cancer by burning off the top. We are not striking at
            the roots, and until we curb our ever increasing population, we can
            never hope to find national recovery.” </p>
