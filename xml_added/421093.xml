        <head>Birth Control Bill Shelves in House; Mrs. Sanger Declares Fight
            Will Go On</head>
        <byline>By <title type="journal">The Associated Press</title>.</byline>
        <dateline><date value="(----)-05-02"/>Feb. 5, <place
                reg="Washington, D.C.">Washington</place></dateline>
        <p><q who="NYT">Birth control crusaders; planning a
                “birth-control-comes-of-age” dinner for Feb. 12, today had their
                legislative hopes for this session dashed by a 15-to-8 vote
                against the Pierce Bill in the <org>House Judiciary
                    Committee</org>.</q></p>
        <p>
            <q who="NYT"><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs. Margaret
                    Sanger</person>, leader of the group, attributed the defeat
                to</q> “the same influences that killed the <org
                reg="International Court of Justice">World Court</org>.”</p>
        <p>
            <q who="NYT">Like those who fought so long for the court, Mrs.
                Sanger was expecting success this session for the Pierce Bill,
                which would have legalized dissemination of contraceptive
                information to physicians and clinics.</q></p>
        <p>“It seems impossible!” <q who="NYT">she exclaimed when first told of
                today’s vote. But she quickly rallied to say it was an “open
                secret” that some of the strongest influences working against
                the court had also opposed her measure.</q></p>
        <p>
            <person reg="Coughlin, Charles">Father Coughlin</person>, whose
            radio speeches brought a shower of anti-World Court letters to
            Senators, once visited the capital to testify against the Pierce
            Bill.</p>
        <p>
            <q who="NYT"><person reg="Pierce, Walter M.">Representative
                    Pierce</person>, Democrat, of <place>Oregon</place>, called
                the setback </q><q who="PIEWA">"an incident in a long
                fight,”</q>
            <q who="NYT">adding that, just the same, the measure</q>
            <q who="PIEWA">“had gained ground decidedly all over the country and
                in <org reg="United States House of Representatives"
                    >Congress</org> too.” </q></p>
        <p><q who="NYT">Said Mrs. Sanger: </q></p>
        <p>“In killing the Birth Control Bill the men who voted against it have
            much to answer for to the womanhood of the country. But this little
            episode is only one of the signposts on a road to certain ultimate
            victory.</p>
        <p> “The fact that there were eight men on the committee with sufficient
            vision, intelligence and courage to stand out against the growing
            insidious influence of dogma encourages me to continue our fight
            until we win. We are not discouraged.”</p>
