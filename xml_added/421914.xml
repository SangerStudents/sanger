        <p>“Birth control is the signal of the new social awakening. It has a
            great significance not only over individual life, but also on the
            communities and the nations of the future,” <q who="ToI">said Mrs.
                Margaret Sanger addressing a public meeting at the Albert Hall
                last night.</q></p>
        <p><q who="ToI">Replying to the question whether they should practice
                    “<foreign lang="HIN">Brahmacharya</foreign>” or have
                unlimited indulgence Mrs. Sanger pointed out that the birth
                control movement as every other movement had its good and evil
                sides and those who desired might have spiritual peace and
                happiness through it.</q>

                instead of controlling it Mrs. Sanger said:</q>"Italy is trying
            to increase her population to make them food for gunfire, but as to
            France her birthrate is much lower than that of <place
