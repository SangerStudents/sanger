        <head>Advocates of Birth Control Await Mrs. Sanger’s Talk </head>

        <p><q who="MCA">Mrs. Sanger spoke yesterday in Knoxville on “The
                Importance of Birth Control in Public Health Plans.” </q></p>
        <p>“Birth control is safe, wise, economical, and wanted by poor
            mothers,” she declared.</p>
        <p>
            <q who="MCA">At Nashville last night, Mrs. Sanger declared the South
                was the</q> “most promising section of the country for birth
            control.” </p>
        <p>“Now that people are getting over their squeamish attitude toward the
            subject that has been so long misunderstood,” Mrs. Sanger said, “the
            South offers the greatest field for development of birth
            control.”</p>
        <p> “The large native born population in the South-- 97 per cent
            according to statistic reports-- and the fact that with the
            exception of about three large centers the people are mostly
            Protestant make the South the most promising section of the country”
                <q who="MCA">for this movement.</q>
