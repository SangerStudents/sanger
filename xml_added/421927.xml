        <p> “Gandhi has aroused the manhood and womanhood of India as no one has
            done in the last century,” <q who="CM">declared Mrs. Margaret
                Sanger, famed champion of birth control, who has just completed
                a 10,000 mile trip through India, this morning, addressing one
                of the largest audiences ever to fill the Memorial
            Chapel.</q></p>

            <q who="CM">Introduced by Dr. <person reg="Himes, Norman E.">Norman
                    E. Himes</person>, assistant professor of Sociology, as
                one</q> “<q who="HIMNO">who has been making history, while I
                have been writing it</q>,” <q who="CM"> Mrs. Sanger opened her
                speech by asserting that we have</q> “the knowledge and the
            skill to solve all of our population problems but we don’t possess
            the virtue to do it.”</p>
        <p>
            <q who="CM">Early marriage and late parenthood were condoned by Mrs.
                Sanger.</q> “Young people should go into marriage with the idea
            of taking two years to get adjusted to each other. If this were done
            we would have more permanent marriages, a more perfect development
            and happier families.” </p>
