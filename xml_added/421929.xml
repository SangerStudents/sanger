        <head>MRS. SANGER RAPS RELIEF ACTIVITIES</head>

        <p> “It is an outrage on public decency, and a breach of faith with the
            taxpayers,” <q who="IS">Margaret Sanger, president of the
                    <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
                    Control</org>, said yesterday in commenting on actions of
                relief agencies. These agencies, she said, are encouraging an
                increase in the birth rate in the families of the unemployed by
                telling mothers that they will have a quicker consideration if
                they can report a condition of pregnancy.</q></p>

            <head type="sub">Masses Lose Confidence</head>
            <p>“It has become apparent to every thinking individual that the
                masses have lost confidence in the new deal and in our present
                paternalistic administration,” she said. “The problem that
                confronts the country is much more complicated than turning out
                one set of politicians or bringing in another: the men in power
                refuse to face facts, and one pertinent fact is that improved
                machinery has reduced the number of workers needed for
                production.”</p>
            <q who="IS">
                <p>Mrs. Sanger is the leader of the largest birth control clinic
