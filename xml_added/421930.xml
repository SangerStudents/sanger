        <head>MRS. SANGER URGERS BIRTH RATE CUT IF U.S. IS 'OUT FOR WAR'</head>

        <p>“If America is out for war, it isn’t time to boost our birth
            rate.”</p>
        <p>
            <q who="CDT">This was the comment yesterday of Mrs. Margaret Sanger,
                pioneer advocate of birth control, at a press interview in the
                Drake Hotel. Mrs. Sanger, who lives in <place reg="Tucson, AZ"
                    >Tucson, Ariz.</place>, came here to be the principal
                speaker today at the 25th anniversary luncheon of the Planned
                Parenthood association of the Chicago area in the <org>Palmer
                    House</org>. </q>
        </p>
        <p>“If we’re smart, we will realize that a population of 2, 3 or 4
            million babies is not an asset in war time,” she contended.
                “<place>Russia</place> found that out. They allowed abortions
            for eight years, kept 20 million babies from being born, and thus
            had 20 million less mouths to feed. It was a great asset to winning
            the war at that time.” </p>
