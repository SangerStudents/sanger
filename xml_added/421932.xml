            <q who="SAES">The speaker remarked that she had long since curtailed
                her attendance at <org
                    reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned
                    Parenthood</org> meetings in <place reg="United States"
                    >America</place>, spending most of her time in
                    <place>Italy</place>, <place>Germany</place>, and
                    <place>Japan</place>, where she felt the birth control
                advocacy was more sorely needed. But that,</q> “The famed
            feminine wiles of southern womanhood, of which I’ve heard all my
            life [] me. I was convinced by letter than the San Angelo
            organization could not have this state meeting without my presence;
            that it needed my advice and encouragement. And what do I find? One
            of the most efficient organizations possible, and with such an
            enviable record,” <q who="SAES">Mrs. Sanger said.
                    <place>Europe</place> has always offered less barriers to
                her movement; and today, the question of population is of
            </q>“overwhelming concern because it is increasing far beyond the
            resources of the countries.” </p>
