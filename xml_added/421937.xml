        <p> “A medical program under government control would permit pressure
            groups hostile to planned parenthood to stifle the movement through
            political pressure,” she said. </p>
        <p>“Already in the state public health programs of
                <place>Massachusetts</place> and <place>Connecticut</place>
            certain doctors have been forbidden the use of hospital facilities
            because political blocs objected to their being in favor of planned
            parenthood,” she added. </p>
