                Francisco</place></dateline>
        <q who="LMA"><p>
                <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, noted birth control
                authority, declared today that if the world’s population continues to increase as it
                is at present it will soon be impossible to feed everyone.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Sanger, in San Francisco as the guest of the <org
                    reg="San Francisco Planned Parenthood Committee">planned parenthood
                    committee</org>, cited research of the <org
                    reg="United States Department of Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</org> to
                back up her startling statement.</p>
            <p> She said the research shows clearly that a definite amount of land is necessary to
                provide food for a given number of people.</p>
            <p> For example, she said, the research shows that it requires 200 acres of good soil to
                provide sufficient meat for nine persons daily, and another 100 acres to provide 40
                children with their daily supply of milk.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Sanger urged extensive research in birth control as a means of avoiding
                overpopulation and the sociological problems related to it.</p>
            <p> At an <org
                    reg="International Congress on Population and World Resources in Relation to the Family"
                    >international conference on population and world resources</org> to be held in
                    <place>England</place> in August, Mrs. Sanger will be allowed one day on the
                program to discuss the need for birth control research.</p></q>
        <p>
            <q who="LMA">She said <place>Sweden</place> is far ahead of the rest of the world in
                birth control education, and that <place>Germany</place>, <place>Italy</place> and
                    <place>Japan</place> are</q> “in dire need” <q who="LMA">of such
            education</q>.</p>
