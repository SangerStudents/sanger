            <q who="EPT"><p> Birth control is not abortion, is not illegal and is no longer
                    guesswork, Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, leading
                    advocate of birth control, assured 15 El Paso husbands at a meeting in the <org
                        reg="El Paso Mother's Health Center">Mothers’ Health Center</org>, 1820 East
                    Rio Grande Street, Thursday night, when she appealed that mothers for the sake
                    of their own health be given the right to space the births of their
                    children.</p></q>
            <q who="EPT"><p> A mother’s body is depleted of many important chemicals at the birth of
                    her child, and it requires six months for her to return to normal, Mrs. Sanger
                    said. It is a crime for these mothers to become pregnant again before their
                    bodies are normal, she maintained.</p></q>
            <p> “Every woman, rich or poor, robust or delicate, should have the right to space her
                children at least two years apart in order that she may be properly rested before
                renewing the ordeal of childbirth,” <q who="EPT">Mrs. Sanger said.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub"> Cites Patriotism</head>
            <q who="EPT"><p> Four out of seven tuberculosis women have died in pregnancy, she said.
                    Women suffering from tuberculosis, heart trouble, goiter, high blood pressure
                    and other diseases should not have children, yet they might marry and live happy
                    lives without them, she said.</p></q>
            <q who="EPT"><p> Persons, fathers or mothers, with communicable diseases certainly
                    should not have children, she insisted. There is more patriotism in spacing
                    children or not having any, she said, than there is in bearing children
                    haphazardly or children afflicted.</p></q>
            <q who="EPT"><p> Decidedly in favor of early marriages, Mrs. Sanger said she is not in
                    favor of adolescents having children. Boys between the ages of 14 and 23, and
                    girls between the ages of 12 and 22 are in that adolescent period when the
                    nervous system is under an intense strain and the bones are still developing.
                    They should postpone parenthood until their own bodies are completely developed,
                    she said.</p></q>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub"> Should Wait Few Years</head>
            <q who="EPT"><p> Even more mature newlyweds should postpone parenthood for a few years,
                    she said, and spend the first two years becoming acquainted and adjusted to
                    insure many years of happy married life.</p></q>
            <p> “We are more ignorant about women today than we are about cows and chickens,” <q
                    who="EPT">she said.</q> “A farmer can write to the <org
                    reg="United States Department of Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</org>
                and get information about his cows and chickens and hogs, how to make them healthy,
                heavier and bear strong offspring. But let someone write and as how a woman might
                control births and raise stronger and healthier children and no information is
                forthcoming, or if it is, it is to the effect that you are breaking the law or being
                immoral.”</p>
            <q who="EPT"><p> Birth control does not, as is frequently argued, make women sterile,
                    she said. Statistics from birth control clinics show women practice birth
                    control for periods of years and still have children when they want them and
                    when they can afford them, she said.</p></q>
            <p> “Birth control is no longer guesswork,” <q who="EPT">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “We know
                now what birth control will do.”</p>

            <head> Says Birth Control Doesn’t Kill Life</head>
            <p> “It is untrue that practice of birth control kills life or that it makes people who
                practice it sterile,” <q who="HP">Mrs. Sanger said at the meeting.</q></p>
            <p> “There is no life at the time that birth control is practiced. The thing we beg of
                the wives who are in no condition to bear children is to take the trouble to prevent
                conception. We know now that birth control is no longer guess work. We know what it
                will do.</p>
            <p> “No woman with tuberculosis, bad kidneys, heart disease and other diseases, should
                become pregnant,” <q who="HP">she said.</q> “No couple should have children when
                either has a disease.</p>
            <p> “We say that every woman should have the right to space her children, whether she is
                rich or poor, well or sick. Two years is the minimum spacing for children. Three
                years is better. Birth takes chemicals out of a woman’s body.</p>
            <p> “There would be fewer separations if couples followed this rule,” <q who="HP">she
                    said.</q></p>
