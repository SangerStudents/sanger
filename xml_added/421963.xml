			<p><q who="HSB">That may well be the answer to controlling the population of the world
					in the future. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs. Margaret Sanger,</person>
					international birth control leader, said yesterday aboard the President
					Wilson.</q></p>
			<p><q who="HSB">She said this was one of the concrete results of the <org>Fifth
						International Conference on Planned Parenthood and Overpopulation</org> she
					recently presided over in <place reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokyo.</place></q></p>
			<p>"For the first time biologists and chemists have given us hope-hope of a means to
				stabilize the birth and death rates.</p>

			<head type="sub">BIRTH RATE RISES</head>
			<p>"At present in most countries the birth rate is up and the death rate is down. We'll
				never have peace until we control the population," <q who="HSB">said Mrs.
					Sanger.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="HSB">The pill about which she spoke is the hormone progesterone. Taken under
					medical direction, it prevents the ovum from conceiving.</q></p>
			<p>"Experiments in the <place>United States</place> have shown it to be harmless and
				effective but expensive.</p>
			<p>Until it can be manufactured synthetically it will be too expensive for mass
				distribution." <q who="HSB">said Mrs. Sanger.</q></p>
			<p><q who="HSB">She added, although it is being used in the U.S. today, it is still in
					the experimental stage.</q></p>
			<p><q who="HSB">Mrs. Sanger and her traveling companion, <person reg="Houghton, Vera"
						>Mrs. Vera Houghton</person> of <place reg="London, England">London,</place>
					international secretary of the <org

						Federation,</org> stated the conference was the most successful on

			<p><q who="HOUVE">"There's been a change of attitude all over the world toward birth
					control in the past five years,"</q>

			<p><q who="HOUVE">The step which the <org>Indian government</org> took in supporting a

			<p><q who="HSB">Like <place>India,</place>
					<place>Japan</place> is beginning government birth control programs.</q></p>
			<p><q who="HSB">But in Mrs. Sanger's opinion the Japanese </q> "are not doing
