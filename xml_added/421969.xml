        <div type="section">
            <p>After a 50-year crusade, Mrs. Margaret Sanger, now 71, still vigorously believes the
                answer to the world's economic problems lies in birth control.</p>
            <p>She thinks Hawaii should pay heed, too.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger stopped ion Honolulu today as a guest of the <org>Watumull
                    Foundation</org>. She is en route back to <place>Japan</place> for another birth
                control meeting, and is making the trip even though she had "to scrape the bottom of
                the barrel" to finance it.</p>
            <p>"Keep birth control out of politics and religion," she said today. "Be guided by your
                scientists and economists."</p>

        <div type="section">
            <head type="subhead">LESS DANGER SIGNS</head>
            <p>She said the economic reports she has seen on Hawaii indicate it faces the danger of
                having more people than its industries can support in the years to come. </p>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger spent today at the SurfRider Hotel and leaves tonight by Japan Air
                Lines.</p>
            <p>While in Japan she will confer with Japanese officials on an April, 1955
                International <org>Planned Parenthood</org> Federation scheduled there. "Some new
                methods of birth control will be disclosed at that time," she said.</p>

        <div type="section">
            <head type="subhead">MUCH OPPOSITION</head>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger said "we haven't won yet... subtle and brutal forces" continue to work
                against the program.</p>
