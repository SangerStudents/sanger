        <p>"The Phoenix clinic has to get a good lawyer and show it is doing
            nothing illegal," Mrs. Sanger said here today. </p>
        <p>Mrs. Sanger said, "We looked into that when we first started the
            clinic here (in 1935) and the only thing we could find that was
            illegal was to advertise publicly.</p>
        <p>"We went to Phoenix then, went through that with the attorney
            general's office up there and that was what we found. We've always
            told the Phoenix people not to advertise and I don't believe they
            have. The first thing they've got to do is get a good lawyer and
            show they're doing nothing illegal."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Sanger indicated she will throw her weight behind the Phoenix
            clinic in this fight. She said she would go to Phoenix, if
            necessary, after she ascertains the full extent of the problem.</p>
