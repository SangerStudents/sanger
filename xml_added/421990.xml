        <p>"What I want is wanted children," said Mrs. Sanger yesterday at the Reef.</p>
        <p>"You can't set a size for all families--the number of children depends on the particular
            situation of the parents--but a child should be wanted before it is born.</p>
        <p>"It should not have to be unwatned, abused, cruelly treated, or brought into an
            environment of misery and even death by parents who have no right to have children."</p>
        <p>"Recently, while I was in <place>India</place>, I asked mothers about the health of their
            pathetic babies. Often the answer was 'Baby hungry in my belly too long.'</p>
        <p>"The child was starving before it was born.</p>
        <p>"Do you realize 66 per cent of India's population never has one full meal a day? Ninety
            per cent has never known meat. The only milk they've tasted is their mother's.</p>
        <p>"Asia has more than one-half the population of the globe crowded in one-sixth of its land
            area, and 50,000 babies are added to it EVERY day.</p>
        <p>"THE WORLD POPULATION" is far outdistancing the food supply, especially proteins.
            According to the Department of Agriculture, it takes 100 good grazing acres to give nine
            people meat once a day.</p>
        <p>"In 1936 I traveled in India a year, setting up 65 birth control centers. War destroyed
            many of them, but the seeds were sown.</p>
        <p>"I just received a letter this week saying that the Indian government has agreed to
            allocate $8 million to be used solely for family planning work.</p>
        <p>"In 1954 I was invited to <place>Japan</place> by <person reg="Kawasaka, Hidejo">Hidejo
                Kawasaka</person>, the minister of health, who is doing everything in his power to
            help the people of his country control the size of their families. The midwives are now
            instructed to teach birth control.</p>
        <p>"I PREDICT THAT IT WON'T take many generations for India and Japan to lead the world in
            eugenic populations because the governments are now directing their efforts in slum
            areas to controlling the increase of the transmissably diseased and dysgenic portions of
            the population.</p>
        <p>"In America, which has as many new babies as India, we haven't touched the lower strata
            of society for whom the movement was started. The women are so family-bound that they
            are unable to visit one of the 600 clinics of the <org>Planned Parenthood</org> League
            throughout America. </p>
        <p>"The public health officials are also the sinners; they make no effort and have no policy
            for teaching birth control.</p>
        <p>"ALSO THE MOVEMENT LACKS funds for research. We are using today the same methods that I
            brought back from <place>Germany</place> and <place>Holland </place>in 1915.</p>
        <p>"Fortunately it is a method which requires a doctor's advice in adjustment, so the
            medical profession has been brought into the movement. But it is a method which is
            outdated compared to the advances made in other fields of science.</p>
        <p>"The oral contraceptive, or pill, called Progesterone, which is being developed in the
            research laboratory of <person reg="Pincus, Gregory">Dr. Pinkus,</person> of <place
                reg="Worcester, MA">Worcester</place>, has proved 100 per cent satisfactory with
            animals as well as with the controlled number of women tested.</p>
        <p>"The woman is immunized against conception for periods which last four months. But the
            pill does not sterilize, and she can conceive when the four month's immunization wears
            off.</p>
        <p>"I FEEL THE IDEAL SOLUTION is an injection which can be administered every six months.
            Science has developed vaccinations against cholera, diphtheria, polio and countless
            other threats to the health of mankind. It is not impossible that the day will come when
            family planning will be as simple and universal.</p>
        <p>"On that day you will see the birth of a happier, healthier world population."</p>
