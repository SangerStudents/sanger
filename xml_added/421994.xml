        <head>Mrs. Sanger Lauds Birth Stand of Episcopalians</head>
        <p>Contacted at her home, 65 Sierra Vista, Mrs. Sanger said, "This is
            the way we expect a church of intelligence and responsibility to
            act. Naturally, I am very pleased.</p>
        <p>"The importance to the nation and the world by the Episcopal Church's
            action can't be underestimated. I am especially glad to see that the
            church's convention goes on record to recommend government assitance
            (on birth control information) when it is officially sought by other
            nations.</p>
        <p>"This is the action we need," Mrs. Sanger added. "When India asked
            the U.S. for information on birth control, former President <person
                reg="Eisenhower, Dwight">Eisenhower</person> wouldn't touch it.
            He was wrong. Public education of all kinds, especially in this
            crucial matter, is certainly a part of our government's
            responsibility."</p>
