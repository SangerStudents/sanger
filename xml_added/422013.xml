		<head>Says Flappers Just Part of Evolution</head>
		<p><q who="HMH">Flapperism isn't a frivolity, says Mrs. Margaret Sanger. </q></p>
		<p>"It is a natural step in the evolution and development of women. It is a swing of the
			pendulum from the Puritanism of the two most puritanical of nations, the <place>United
				States</place> and <place>England</place>.</p>
		<p>"From Flapperism," <q who="HMH">Mrs. Sanger said</q> "women will develop into dignified
			forceful citizens. They will be more intelligent, broader. Women are the coming power in
			the nation, and for a period they will dominate man and be superior to him.</p>
		<p>"When men see that women have developed superior intellects, they will rise above their
			standards, and the result will be a higher type than ever before of both men and
			women."</p>
		<p><q who="HMH">So, Flappers, don't be so carefree! You've got a serious mission to perform
				of raising womanhood!</q></p>
