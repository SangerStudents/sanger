		<head>Mrs. Sanger Makes Plea For Birth Control Before A Large Audience Here</head>
		<p>"Don't let prejudice and ignorance wipe out civilization," <q who="HMH">was the plea made
				by Margaret Sanger, <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>, President of the
					<org>American Birth Control League</org>, speaking to one thousand and 88 men
				and women who packed Stouffer's Academy last night to hear her speak.</q></p>
		<p>"Countries having highest birth rates are those which have not increased in population
			while those having low birth rates--such as <place>Australia</place>--have increased in
			population. Control of the birth rate is an aid to increased population because higher
			death rates always acompany large birth rates, the speaker explained. Prejudice and
			ignorance are the two factors fighting the movement to allow control of the birth rate,
			and eventually will lead back to a degenerate civilization.</p>
		<p>"The world is divided into two groups--not the rich and the poor--but the small family
			group and the the large family group. In small families is found self-reliance,
			self-respect, happiness, leisure, comfort: the children in small families attend school
			and college and usually fill the highest positions in church and state.</p>
		<p>"On the other hand is the large family group where is found misery, ignorance, poverty,
			sickness, child labor--this misery perpetuating itself in increasing numbers.</p>
		<p>"For the alleviating of this suffering a whole social system has been erected, with
			thousands of social service workers employed devoting their lives to trying to ease the
			misery brought about by the unwise and endless reproduction.</p>
		<p>"More than 90% of children who die in infancy are of poverty or neglect, and yet there
			are no steps taken to prevent the parents of those children from bringing into the world
			300,000 more children to die of poverty and neglect the next year.</p>
		<p>"The trouble is," <q who="HMH">said Mrs. Sanger,</q> "we don't get at the real cause of
			human misery. We are like an ostrich who sticks his head in the sand and refuses to face
			facts.</p>
		<p>"I would like to see a civilization where parenthood is a privilege," <q who="HMH">she
				said.</q></p>
		<p>"Birth control is the keynote of a new social awakening. It is a principle interlocked
			with the spiritual progress of the race. Nature has always been a most ruthless advocate
			of birth control. Nature's methods are famine and pestilence and scourge and wars.</p>
		<p>"No wonder the world is in this state of chaos. We have got to put a check upon the
			growing population of the feeble minded, insane and diseased, until the world catches
			up. </p>
		<p>"They say it is 'against the laws of nature.' So is shaving against the laws of nature
			(much laughter from the audience.) So is walking on two feet instead of fours against
			the laws of nature. So is sailing in boats, and flying in the air, against the laws of
			nature.</p>
		<p> "But, if self-preservation is the first law of nature, then birth control is within
			nature's laws, for self-preservation depends on birth control."</p>
		<p><q who="HMH">Answering the argument that birth control would increase immorality, Mrs.
				Sanger said that of all the thousands of woman who have come to her for advice,
				there has never been an unmarried girl ask for information.</q></p>
		<p>"It is an insult to women, and an insult to Christianity to say that, if women are not
			capable of standing on their own inner strength of character, the generations of
			Christian teachings have failed. It is a weak morality that is moral because of fear of
			the consequences. People have to be taught the proper use of knowledge. They can be
			safeguarded only by the firmness, the intelligence, the strength within them.</p>
		<p>"Are people interested in the subject" <q who="HMH">Mrs. Sanger was asked.</q></p>
		<p><q who="HMH">In reply, she told of letters received by her from women all over the
				country, averaging more than 1000 a day.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"These letters, coming for the most part from poor mothers of the tenements, the
			factories and the workshops--have to go unanswered because a Federal statute forbids the
			giving of such information through the mails."</p>
