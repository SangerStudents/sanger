        <head>Margaret Sanger Explains Birth Control Movement</head>
        <p>"Birth control is a conscious control of the birth rate by means of preventing
            conception," <q who="DC"><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs. Margaret Sanger,</person>
                originator of the birth control movement, gives as her definition of the work she
                has been doing for more than 30 years.</q></p>
        <q who="DC"><p>Mrs. Sanger is in <place reg="State College, PA">State College</place>
                visiting her brother Coach <person reg="Higgins, Robert A.">Bob Higgins,</person>
                professor of physical education.</p>
            <p>She points out that birth control does not mean to limit or interfere with life,
                because life is not there to destroy. Many people, Mrs. Sanger said, at first
                believed that it advocates abortion, which is very far from the idea.</p>
            <p>The first organization started in 1921. Now called "<org>The Planned Parenthood
                    Federation of America</org>," it has its own <org
                    reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">research bureau</org> which is the
                largest of its kind in the world. It gives marriage counseling to more than 6,000
                new patients each year.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger said that her first publication, "<title type="journal">The Woman
                    Rebel</title>" was published for the express purpose of exposing the <name
                    type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Comstock Law</name>.
                It lasted almost a year, but each copy was suppressed almost immediately after
                printing. Today the organization publishes the scientific <title type="journal"
                    >"Journal of Fertility"</title> and the <title type="journal">"Birth Control
                    News,"</title> which is distributed to its members.</p>
            <p>When asked about other hindrances that faced her and the organization, she said that
                the big trouble today is in getting religious leaders to see the value of this
                movement and to secure their help. However, many clergymen have helped, and more are
                pointing in that direction.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Sanger said that she has many hobbies, but at the moment painting is occupying
                her attention. While visiting at the <org reg="Pennsylvania State University"
                    >College,</org> she is studying painting under <person reg="Pittman, Hobson"
                    >Hobson Pittman,</person> nationally-known artist and summer instructor at the
                College.</p></q>
