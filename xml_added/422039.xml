        <p><q who="DE"><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger,</person> the "Woman Rebel," took issue with <person reg="Roosevelt, Theodore">Theodore Roosevelt</person> Sunday night when she declared,</q> "It is about time the race commits suicide if it can't take any better care of its children than it does now."</p>
        <q who="DE"><p>She spoke at <org>Marble hall,</org> and declared that 300,000 children die annually from poverty and neglect: that 95 percent of these come from parents who average nine children, and that over-production is making the working class a race of slaves bound hand and foot by poverty, disease and mental deficiency.</p>
        <p>She claims the <place>United States</place> is the only civilized country in the world that has such stringent laws in regard to birth control, she charged that the wealthy are able to evade these laws but the poor are told there is no help for them, as "it is against the law to give information regarding birth control."</p>
        <p>She said that in <place>New Zealand</place> and <place reg="Netherlands">Holland,</place> where such knowledge is freely given, infant mortality is lowest, and the standard of mortality is highest.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Sanger left <place reg="Denver, CO">Denver</place> Monday morning for <place reg="Los Angeles, CA">Los Angeles.</place> She will return to Denver the last of June.</p></q>
