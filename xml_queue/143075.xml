<head>FREDERICK NIETZSCHE.</head>
<dateline>[<date value="1914-11-00">Nov.-Dec. 1914</date>]</dateline>
<p>The powerful mind of <person reg="Nietzsche, Frederich">Nietzsche</person> has exerted an
influence in <place>Europe</place> which has made itself felt in all philosophy&amp; letters of the
past ten years.</p>
<p>His gospel of life has awakened new channels of thought in other writers &amp; preached under the
forceful, vigorous forum of aphorisms has broken loose from the dogmatic travels school which had
dominated the world of Western thought since <person reg="Kant, Immanuel">Kant</person>.</p>
<p>The philosophy of Nietzsche has attracted attention in literary circles in <place>France</place>
<place>England</place>
<place>America</place> besides giving birth to literature abundant in quantity &amp; varying in
quality in <place>Germany</place>.</p>
<p>It is to me regrettable that such interest in the seems to remain outside the reach of the
workers--for whom it is intended. Nietzsche philosophy not only calls in question the moral law
itself it challenges &amp; attacks the foundations of all moral law. Before this almost all schools
of philosophy had been agreed upon the fact that a universal moral law exists.</p>
<p><person reg="Stirner, Max">Max Stirner</person> was perhaps the first to deny the existence of it
&amp; preach the gospel of immoralism but Stirner name remains almost unknown to us.</p>
<p>But in Nietzsche lyrical <unclear>enthusiasts</unclear> in <title type="book">Zarathustra
</title>he first called general attention to the fact that serious reasons exist for preferring the
immoral to the moral--the untrue to the true.</p>
<p>Perhaps no where thru N-- philosophy can it be felt that he intended to deduce any sociological
conclusions from his philosophy, rather did mean it as an expression of <del>his</del>
<add>a</add> personality, <add>a</add> character &amp; of a temperment--but nevertheless we have a
right to extract from this or any philosophy that which we can use for our own purpose &amp; so I
claim the right of the worker to deduce in Nietzsches philosophy as much as they can use for their
own.</p>
<p>It is impossible to apply his philosophy of Nietzsche or to study or know him before first
getting an insight into the tremendous personality which so strongly reveals itself through every
line of his work in every aphorism of his mind.</p>
<p>Sincerity &amp; heroism are the two characteristics of Nietzsches personality and a third may be
added a delicacy of sentiment &amp; refinement. These characteristics give us a clue to his rupture
with his once dearest friend <person reg="Wagner, Richard">Wagner</person>. They give us a clue to
his hatred of the democratic &amp; plebian movement to his hatred of the Christian religion "All or
nothing" was his motto &amp; he lived up to it.</p>
<p> As one of his biographers (<person reg="Hill, ?">Hill</person>) has said of him </p>
<p> "<q who="HIL">Gifted with an extraordinary refinement of sentiment &amp; taste; having set
himself as an ideal Life itself, &amp; Life in beauty, in plentitude, in power in exuberance of
wealth; he was determined to be sincere with himself at all &amp; every cost, to examine every
ideal, however ancient, however universal its acceptance; to examine it to the bottom, to reject it
if necessary at what ever cost or friendship or of suffering to himself; to affirm &amp; reaffirm
his ideal, that ideal which he held to be true; to affirm &amp; reaffirm in the face of the whole
world if necessary, without compromise.</q></p>
<p><q who="HIL">To be able to do this-- to be able to attack &amp; reject all that which mankind has
hitherto by almost universal acceptance, held sacred to be able to sacrifice all these ideas which
tradition &amp; education have rendered personally of value to be able to sacrifice friends that one
loves &amp; venerates on the altar of ones convictions--to do this requires courage above the
ordinary--it requires heroism.</q>"</p>
<p>His refinement of taste his third great characteristic can not be submerged by the two other
traits. He is essentially an artist. Some think him more an artist than a thinker or rather that his
career as thinker is subordinated to his artistic properties-- He wrote poetry it is true he also
loved music &amp; composed some, but greater &amp; more important than these was the fact that his
whole conception of life was an artistic <del>production</del> conception.</p>
<p>He was born in 1844 at <place reg="Richen, Germany">Richen in Germany</place>.</p>
<p>I am not going into detail with the incidents of his biography only to relate here &amp; there in
passing the events which influenced his life. </p>
<p>As his father was a protestant pastor he naturally was brought up in a religious atmosphere. Tho'
it was neither bigoted nor austere.</p>
<p>Its interesting to note in passing that <add>tho'</add> Nietzsche who hated Christianity &amp;
broke away from its chains, that he bitterly attacked the faith of his forefathers. He who
proclaimed in all places &amp; at all times that "<q who="NIEFR">God was dead</q>" that he was
beyond &amp; above all religion &amp; supernatural belief--yet by his great worship of truth by his
idealization of life his fearless &amp; intrepid sincerity that he was really activated by the
deepest religious principles.</p>
<p>He was far above churches &amp; religion yet he believed in life, in life as a manifestation of
Beauty he believed in principles &amp; lived up to his principles.</p>
<p>His study of Greek did more than anything else to reveal Nietzsche to himself.</p>
<p>Already many writers might be named who owe if not half their ideas, at least half their courage
to their ideas to Nietzsche. No other man is more representative of the spirit of his age (<person
reg="Emerson, Ralph Waldo">Emerson</person>, <person reg="Blake, William">Blake</person>, <person
reg="Ibsen, Henrik">Ibsen</person>--) he was his age for he understood the mind of Europe.</p>
<p>Its significant that his main attack should be leveled against the foundations of European
morality. The greatest immoralist the modern world has seen -- he needed the humane qualities he
possessed to stand alone against a continent &amp; a tradition of 2000 years. </p>
<p>Passion the characteristic of his thought, <title type="book">Birth of Tragedy</title>, his first
book. No bombast-- no out pouring of big minds to cover up little ideas.</p>
<p>The greatest events he says are <del>our</del> greatest thoughts--the product of our stillest
hour.</p>
<p>"<q who="NIEFR">The secret of a joyful life is to live dangerously.</q>"</p>
<p> Throw not away the hero in thy soul.</p>
<p> What is bad? All that proceeds from weakness.</p>
<p> (<title type="book">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</title>)</p>
<p> ascending &amp; descending character. The need of salvation--in the sincerest form of expression
of decadence.</p>
<p>Nietzsche sees the world becoming peopled with a ludicrous species--a tame, <gap
reason="illegible"/> sickly, mediocre kind of gently--grunting domestic animal.</p>
<p>What is good?--all that elevates the feeling of power--</p>
<p> What is bad? All that proceeds from weakness.</p>
<p> What is happiness? The feeling that power increases--that resistance is being overcome.</p>
<p>Philosophers have never dared to case doubt upon the lawfulness of moral judgements--but it is
Nietzsche who dares to declare war on all morals, mans instructs etc. "<q who="NIEFR">There is a
morality of Master &amp; a Morality of Slaves-- Moral values have been determined either by a race
of Masters, conscious &amp; proud of the distance that separates them from the ruled race--or by a
crowd of subjective ones, slaves, inferiors of all kinds.</q>" page 120 <title>Gospel</title></p>
<p>
<q who="NIEFR">Man must retain all the knowledge aptitudes &amp; new strength acquired in the course
of his long &amp; painful experiences but he must break up the <add>tablet of</add> laws which at
present hinder him in his march forward--he must renounce the present historical values, the
Christian, democratic ascetic ideal, &amp; create Master values of his own. </q>page 174
<title>Gospel</title>.</p>
<p> Power of laughter (a secret unknown) page 204 -- "<q who="NIEFR">Free dost thou call
thyself.</q>"</p>
<p>Nietzsche--what he taught the worker</p>
<p>His teachings.</p>
<p>1st a teacher of Eternal recurrences everything repeats itself, life, earthly solar system.</p>
<p>2nd He applied the principle of evolutions to the extant system of morals.</p>
<p>3 He tried to trace the origin of our present day morals, &amp; found that we must create a new
ethics which are beyond good &amp; evil.</p>
<p>4. He attacked the <add>morality of</add> Christianity perhaps more vigorously than any previous
writer (<person>Voltaire</person>). He claims it teaches a slave morality &amp; teachers a Master
morality is higher to aim at. Yea to life in its fullness &amp; all that is high, beautiful &amp;
daring.</p>
<p><person reg="Schopenhauer, Arthur">Schopenhauer</person> his <add>first</add> great teacher. He
found a book &amp; read it &amp; became charmed &amp; captivated, a devoted follower personality
&amp; his teachings.</p>
<p> One can scarcely separate a mans personality from his life--neither can we separate it from his
teachings.</p>
<p> As a Philosopher--the government has always tended to capture &amp; employ the Philosopher of
its age, but what State would patronize <person>Plato</person> or Schopenhauer.</p>
<p>When you get to the Library get some of the works on Nietzsche-- You will understand the coming
generation and what is in the air today when you have read &amp; grasped his philosophy--for
instance his liking our civilization (?) and character into three states--the camel--the lion--&amp;
the child.</p>
<p>The camel takes all the heavy loads &amp; burdens &amp; goes into the wilderness where he dwells
in solitude &amp; loneliness but the weight of the burdens strengthens him &amp; he becomes a lion
&amp; as Nietzsche says a "<q who="NIEFR">laughing lion</q>"-- &amp; "<q who="NIEFR">freedom it will
take as its prey &amp; be lord in its own wilderness.</q>" </p>
<p>"<q who="NIEFR">To create freedom for his self--and a holy <gap reason="illegible"/> even towards
duty;--for this my heathern, there is need of a lion.</q>" </p>
<p>Again, "<q who="NIEFR">a sense of truth in a sense of security.</q>"</p>
<p> Attraction &amp; repulsion, reason &amp; energy, love &amp; hate are necessary to human
existence.</p>
<p> From these contraries come what is called good &amp; evil.</p>
<p> Good is the passive that obeys reason evil is the active springing from energy. Good in Heaven,
Evil in Hell.</p>
<p> Those who restrain desire do so because the desire is weak enough to be restrained. Reason
usurps its place &amp; governs the weak &amp; unwilling and being restrained, it by degrees becomes
passive till it is only the shadow of desire.</p>
<p> Prudence is a rich old maid courted by incapacity.</p>
<p> The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom.</p>
<p> Exuberance is Beauty.</p>
<p>Sooner murder an infant in the cradle than nurse unacted desires.</p>
<p> I must create a system of be enslaved by another mans. I will not reason &amp; compare my
business is to create.</p>
<p> The chains are the cunning of weak &amp; timid <add>tame</add> minds.</p>
<p> There are two classes of men are always upon the Earth. They should be enemies whoever tries to
reconcile them seeks to destroy <del>them</del> existence. Religion is an endeavor to reconcile the
two.</p>
<p> The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water &amp; breeds reptiles of the
mind.</p>
<p>The significance of the individual--of the consciousness of the individual. First that the
individual is the original source &amp; constituent of all value. No other standard of obligations
for you or for me than that set by our personal ends &amp; ideals.</p>
<p>"<q who="NIEFR">The triumph of life!-- The great yearning to all things high, beautiful,
daring</q>"! </p>
<p>"<q who="NIEFR">No one knoweth yet what is good &amp; evil.</q>" </p>
<p>What a shock these words must have given Europe--Europe with its priestcraft popery &amp;
Culture-- No wonder <gap reason="illegible"/> that the many who dared to thunder out the above words
was considered a madman--good &amp; evil--did not Europe know what it was.</p>
<p>Two lessons to be learned from Nietzsche--to understand Aristocracy &amp; to acquire a subtle
methods of thinking.</p>
<p>His love of music was strong in him at an early age.</p>
