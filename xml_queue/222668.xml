        <p> Tall, shy, a veritable white giant with his enormous shock of hair, the personality of
                <person reg="Ellis, Havelock">HE</person> was that of a pioneer. . . for pioneer he
            has been in all of his more important pursuits.</p>
        <p>The labors of this genius, unique in history, to bring to women &amp; men alike a better
            understanding of their physical mental &amp; spiritual creative functions.</p>
        <p>In generations yet to come posterity will recognize HE as the one who opened the
            spiritual portals of the twentieth century and revealed sex as a spiritual factor in the
            lives of men &amp; women.</p>
        <p> In this alone he has rendered incalculable aid in bringing about a better era for human
            kind. </p>
        <p>Havelock like nearly all great thinkers has been content to live simply &amp; in what
            many would consider poverty &amp; obscurity.</p>
        <p>His work &amp; fame in Sex psychology is <add>now</add> universally recognized but he was
                <add>as</add> indifferent to applause &amp; praise as he was to abuse &amp;
            criticism. </p>
