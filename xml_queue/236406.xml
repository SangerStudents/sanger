        <p><person>Pres Bank of England</person>--</p>
        <p>Reminded me of <person reg="Wells, H.G.">H.G. Wells</person> prophecy.</p>
        <p>Conditions of Social &amp; Economic chaos today stem back to the careless, reckless, <gap
                extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> prolific breeding of our forebears who while
            giving up service to such ideas as the “Sacred work of Mother” the “<q>Sacredness of
                Motherhood</q>” did nothing to dignify or to enoble <add>it</add> or to protect the
            fundamental rights of mothers or to give them knowledge &amp; freedom whereby Mothers
            could bring into the world only the number of children she could bear &amp; rear as a
            service to the Country &amp; to the race.</p>
        <p>Motherhood throughout the ages has been the stepping stones for Oligarchies Kingdoms
            &amp; Democracies. It has been the upon this Sacred function that Tyrants &amp; War
            Lords have ascended to heights of renown.</p>
