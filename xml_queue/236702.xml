        <p>We will in 200 years increase to 2,000 million</p>
        <p>Who shall inhabit our land--</p>
        <p>Main essential question is one of understanding -- We can not go forward in peace &amp;
            prosperity alone</p>
        <p>No splendid isolation for us spiritually</p>
        <p>We will have to go back &amp; mark time until all nations emerge same point of

        <p>Two groups in Japan -- Conservative old -- young progressive</p>
        <p>Western civilization has invaded Japan</p>
        <p>bringing our life saving clinics, sanitation, hygiene, surgery, charities, &amp;
            philanthropy</p>
        <p>rescuing sick, feeble and diseased making their problems more complex</p>
        <p>She can no longer resort to nature -- cruel methods of reducing these populations by
            disease &amp; famine</p>
        <p>She has gone beyond that, as have we of the Western Countries -- we must reach out to
            science to help us. That science is Birth Control.</p>
        <p>Japan has a population of 56 million people </p>
        <p>Within an area no larger than California</p>
        <p>Half the population of the whole of USA</p>
        <p>She has a survival rate of an increasing number of inhabitants to the number of 700,000
            to 1 million a year</p>
        <p>This far exceedes that of any other country</p>
        <p>The militarists want 100,000 million for Japan to become a world power</p>
        <p>For Japan to win more territory she must have the natural right ---- which is an
            expanding right, for her growing population</p>
        <p>During the past 65 years Japans population has doubled -- so have her problems</p>
        <p>The density of population of 320 to a sq mile</p>
        <p>Relief by emigration -- like <place>germany</place> -- experts education no return to
            government</p>

        <p>Pivot of future peace -- pivot of international problem--</p>
        <p>We are drawn into international affairs--</p>
        <p>Whole world like child--</p>
        <p>We can not go far forward alone--</p>

        <p>large as California--</p>
        <p>depended upon nature, floods, <unclear>famine</unclear> infant mortality--</p>
        <p>Now hygiene &amp; sanitation resources rescues inhabitants &amp; makes problems of
            existence more complex</p>
        <p>Every relief obtained by emigration stimulates the birth rate or survival rate &amp;
            congestion sets in the and whole process is repeated</p>
