		<head>A NEW BOOK.</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>“<title type="book">The Age of Reason</title>” is a delightful book. Every chapter
				leaves you thinking, guessing, pondering, until the end when it finishes with a
				masterly climax. Many references to Birth Control are made throughout in a friendly
				spirit.</p>
			<p>The book brings your thinking up-to-date, and presents you with charming characters
				who fascinate as well as irritate.</p>
			<p>Those with a scientific trend of thought will enjoy is fully, but it is good reading
				for all. The conflict of science and religion goes on in a family of biologists, the
				father of which is married to the daughter of a clergyman.</p>
