		<p>There was a trial going on in the courthouse at <place reg="Salem, MA">Salem,
				Mass</place>. One <person reg="Bruno, Salvatore">Salvatore Bruno</person> had been
			found with a revolver in his pocket one winter morning after a riot between policemen
			and several women who were doing picket duty during the textile strike at <place
				reg="Lawrence, MA">Lawrence</place>.</p>
		<p>A policeman testified that eight Italian women were bent on going toward the mills; they
			were ordered back, and as he touched one of them gently on the shoulder she sat down on
			the sidewalk and began to scream. All the women began to scream, he continued, then
			shots were fired from windows. Bruno, who was across the street, was accused of shooting
			at the policemen.</p>
		<p>Bruno, on the other hand, claimed he heard the screams of the women and saw the policemen
			clubbing them "<q who="BRUSA">lika hell</q>." Becoming greatly excited and hoping to
			scatter the crowd he shot in the air three times. He did not run away, and of course was
			arrested. But not before he had been thrown down and kicked in the face and the body. As
			a result of the beating Bruno showed five scars on his head, his eyes had been closed
			for two weeks and he was under the care of two surgeons. The police argued that finding
			the revolver on his person was sufficient proof that he intended to murder them. The
			only evidence against Bruno was the testimony of the police.</p>
		<p>The jury brought in a verdict of guilty.</p>
		<p>If ever there was a travesty on justice it was there. There sat a judicial monster, who
			by his position had a strangle-hold on thousands of textile workers and from whose
			decision there is no appeal.</p>
		<p>Socialists of <place>New England</place> can well ponder over these facts, for they have
			in their midst as mean a rodent of the law as ever sat under the canopy of the so-called
			Commonwealth of <place>Massachusetts</place>.</p>
		<p>His very evident bias in charging the jury spelled a conviction for Bruno before the
			talesmen adjourned to deliberate.</p>
		<p>We are loud in our protest against the man who runs amuck with dynamite, but what about
			this irresponsible tool who runs amuck every day through the law and the State? It is on
			every tongue that he is the servile tool for the mill owners, and like the ostrich,
			hides his head in the sand of patriotism.</p>
		<p>But is this not typical of New England? Massachusetts has exploited its mill workers for
			generations. She has allowed colossal fortunes to be built up from the sweat and blood
			of the workers. But when cornered patriotism is her last resort. Scratch beneath skin of
			the patriot and you find the blood of the exploiter. Salem is the place where witches
			were once burned at the stake. Salem is just as bigoted now as in the days of
			witchcraft, only the "foreigners" are its victims today. But New England is seething
			with revolt.</p>
		<p>And now will come the trial of <person reg="Ettor, Joseph">Ettor</person> and <person
				reg="Giovannitti, Arturo">Giovannitti</person>. Will they be handed a dose of the
			same justice as was given to Bruno? Ettor is accused of having told the workers that
			there is a class struggle. Think of it. To inform the workers of such a fact. The
				<person reg="Atwill, Henry Converse">District Attorney</person> in his preliminary
			address at the Ettor and Giovannitti trial said in part that these "<q who="ATWHE"
				>buzzards</q>" come from other States to a peaceful community and sowed the seeds of
			discontent and declared that the <org reg="Commonwealth of Massachussetts">commonwealth
				of Massachusetts</org> would not tolerate foreigners bringing such ideas there.</p>
		<p>I have it from reliable sources that Ettor and Giovannitti are no longer in the hands of
			the textile bosses alone but are the victims of a combined effort of the steel and coal
			barons, who are bent on <supplied resp="MSPP">stifling</supplied> labor unrest in the
			East.</p>
		<p>It is a crime to picket. It is a crime to express your class convictions. It will soon be
			a crime to have any ideas at all. The masters are closing in on us. They are making
			their laws more severe. Are you going to help us?</p>
		<p>The Ettor-Giovannitti trial will mark an epoch in the onward march of the revolutionary
			movement. Conviction means a sure check on proletariat progress. They must be
			acquitted.</p>
		<p>The workers of New England are ready to act. Will their brothers and sisters act with
			them? The textile slaves were deceived into going back on the promise that Ettor and
			Giovannitti would be freed. They know that if these men are convicted no worker is safe.
			They know that they fought one of the greatest battles in the history of labor, but they
			know also that the Lawrence strike is lost if Ettor and Giovannitti are convicted. </p>
