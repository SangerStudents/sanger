                <q who="LADN">From <place reg="Honolulu, HI">Honolulu</place> Miss <person
                        reg="Sanger, Margaret">Sanger</person> sent these comments:</q> “Population
                pressure is a cause of war, and <place>Japan</place>, <place>Italy</place> and
                    <place>Germany</place>, through failure to control their birthrates, are
                justifying predictions that they would become the world’s ‘danger spots’.” </p>
            <p><supplied resp="MSPP">Part of this section has been omitted</supplied></p>
            <p> “Japan had 64,000,000 persons when I was there in 1922, and since then the
                population has increased steadily from 800,000 to 1,000,000 a year,” <q who="LADN"
                    >she said</q>. “But despite the annexation of <place>Manchukuo</place>, Japan is
                still land-hungry. It has become, with Germany and Italy, a destroyer of
                civilization through ruthless waging of arrogant warfare against innocent, peaceful
                peoples.</p>
            <p> “All these nations refuse to control their birthrate, and they refuse to give to
                women the simple knowledge that could save the lives of untold thousands of women. </p>
            <p> “Women’s progress in Japan has been retarded- the women have not been able to
                maintain the advances they had made as far back as 1922. Reactionary forces, soon
                after the earthquake, set up a strong, bureaucratic, militaristic government, and
                since then women have not been allowed the natural freedom of evolutionary progress.
                Women are not granted degrees in their colleges and universities, and of all the
                women who have been allowed to attend medical universities, only 16 have been
                granted medical degrees, through ‘special dispensation.’”</p>

            <p> “In Japan,” <q who="LADN">she said</q>, “a campaign of public health is just raising
                its head, and a new health institute which will provide an opportunity for mothers
                in outlying districts to receive medical aid, but not birth control aid, will open
                next year. But one can never foresee what may happen in a militaristic country, and
                so the future is still dark and overclouded.” </p>

            <p> “As far back as 1925,” <q who="NYT">she wrote</q>, “Professor <person
                    reg="Thompson, Warren">Warren Thompson</person>, in his brilliant analysis of
                the population problem, named Italy, Japan and Germany as ‘danger spots’ of the
                world. Japan is fulfilling that prophecy, and not only are these countries the
                danger spots of the world, but they are the destroyers of our civilization through
                their ruthless method of waging arrogant warfare against innocent, peaceful peoples. </p>
            <p> “All of these three nations refuse to control their birth rates and they also refuse
                to give to their women and to their mothers the simple knowledge which could save
                the lives of thousands upon thousands of these women and avoid the destitution,
                misery and enslavement of large masses of their population.”</p>
            <p>
                <q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said Japan</q> “is keenly disappointed over the natural
                resources of Manchukuo and is still land-hungry.”</p>
